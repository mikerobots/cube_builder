I would like to enhance the way this voxel editor works. The first
thing I would like to do is to add a work space to start placing
voxels. This will be a grid that is 32cm squares. This should be the
ground plane. You will be able to point at the grid and click. This
will add voxels to that location. The voxels can be offset from the
32cm markings.
