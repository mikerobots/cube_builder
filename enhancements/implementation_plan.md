# Voxel Editor Enhancement Implementation Plan

**IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:**
- You should only be doing todo lists that are assigned to you.
- If you are working on an item, please update to say (in progress)
- As soon as you complete an item, add a check mark [x]
- Don't pursue the next phase unless someone marks the phase as complete
- If you start working on a phase, please mark it as in progress
- If you finished a task in a phase and it was the last task, mark the phase complete
- Some tasks may already be complete. So please check before implementing
- Detailed requirements captured in requirements.md
