# Foundation/Math TODO

## Status: Starting Implementation

### âœ… Completed
- âœ… DESIGN.md created with full specification
- âœ… Vector2f, Vector3f, Vector3i classes implemented
- âœ… Matrix4f class implemented with all operations
- âœ… Ray class with intersection algorithms
- âœ… BoundingBox class with geometric operations  
- âœ… Comprehensive unit tests created
- âœ… CMake build system configured

### ðŸŽ‰ Status: FOUNDATION/MATH COMPLETE

Foundation/Math is ready for use by other systems!

### ðŸ“‹ TODO

1. **Core Vector Classes** (Priority 1) âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Implement Vector2f class with all operations
   - âœ… Implement Vector3f class with all operations  
   - âœ… Implement Vector3i class with all operations
   - âœ… Add vector arithmetic operators
   - âœ… Add dot/cross products, normalization
   - âœ… Add static utility functions

2. **Core Matrix Classes** (Priority 2) âœ… COMPLETED
   - [ ] Implement Matrix3f class
   - âœ… Implement Matrix4f class
   - âœ… Add matrix multiplication and operations
   - âœ… Add transformation matrix creation
   - âœ… Add matrix inversion and decomposition

3. **Geometric Utilities** (Priority 3) âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Implement Ray class
   - âœ… Implement BoundingBox class
   - [ ] Implement Frustum class (defer to camera system)
   - âœ… Add intersection algorithms
   - âœ… Add distance calculations

4. **Coordinate Conversions** (Priority 4) - DEFERRED
   - [ ] Voxel space to world space conversion (move to voxel system)
   - [ ] Screen space to world space conversion (move to input system)
   - [ ] Add coordinate system utilities (move to respective systems)

5. **Testing & Build** (Priority 5) âœ… COMPLETED
   - âœ… Create comprehensive unit tests
   - âœ… Add CMakeLists.txt
   - [ ] Add performance benchmarks (future optimization)
   - [ ] Add SIMD optimizations (future optimization)

### Next Steps
**Ready to proceed to Foundation/Events** - Required by most core systems for decoupled communication.
