Test Name: VoxelMeshVisualValidation
Test Description: Comprehensive test fixture for visual validation of voxel mesh rendering with OpenGL context setup, GLFW window management, and shader validation infrastructure

Test Name: BasicShaderValidation  
Test Description: Validates that basic shaders compile correctly and can render simple geometry without errors

Test Name: VertexAttributeSetup
Test Description: Tests that vertex attribute configurations (position, normal, color) are properly set up and bound to shader attributes

Test Name: MultipleMeshRendering
Test Description: Validates rendering of multiple mesh objects with proper vertex array object (VAO) management and attribute binding

Test Name: ShaderUniformHandling
Test Description: Tests setting and updating shader uniforms (model, view, projection matrices, lighting parameters) during rendering

Test Name: OpenGLStateManagement
Test Description: Validates proper OpenGL state management including depth testing, blending, and viewport configuration

Test Name: RenderingPipelineIntegration
Test Description: Integration test for the complete rendering pipeline from mesh creation through shader execution to framebuffer output

Test Name: MacOSCompatibility
Test Description: Tests OpenGL compatibility on macOS systems with proper extension loading and VAO macro handling

Test Name: ErrorHandling
Test Description: Validates proper error handling and cleanup when OpenGL operations fail or shaders don't compile

Test Name: PerformanceValidation
Test Description: Tests rendering performance with multiple objects and rapid shader switching scenarios
