Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.DefaultConstruction
Test Description: Tests SparseOctree default construction. Verifies empty octree returns false for all voxel queries, has zero voxel count and memory usage.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.CustomDepthConstruction
Test Description: Tests SparseOctree construction with custom depth. Verifies octree with depth 5 can handle 32x32x32 grid positions.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.SingleVoxelOperations
Test Description: Tests single voxel set/get/clear operations. Verifies voxel can be set to true, retrieved, then cleared with proper count tracking.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.MultipleVoxelOperations
Test Description: Tests operations on multiple voxels. Verifies multiple voxels can be set, retrieved, selectively cleared with accurate count.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.NegativeCoordinates
Test Description: Tests negative coordinate handling. Verifies SparseOctree properly rejects negative coordinates by design for Y>=0 constraint.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.LargeCoordinates
Test Description: Tests large coordinate handling. Verifies coordinates outside octree bounds are rejected while valid large coordinates work correctly.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.RedundantOperations
Test Description: Tests redundant voxel operations. Verifies setting same voxel multiple times succeeds without increasing memory usage.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.ClearOperation
Test Description: Tests clearing all voxels. Verifies clear removes all voxels, resets count to zero, and reduces memory usage.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.OptimizationOperation
Test Description: Tests octree optimization. Verifies optimize preserves all voxels and count while potentially restructuring internal nodes.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.MemoryPoolOperations
Test Description: Tests shared memory pool usage. Verifies multiple octrees can share the same memory pool without interference.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.NonCopyableDesign
Test Description: Tests non-copyable design constraint. Verifies octree maintains proper encapsulation by preventing copy operations.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.StressTestLargeDataset
Test Description: Tests handling 10,000+ voxels without degradation. Verifies octree efficiently stores and retrieves large checkerboard pattern dataset.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.MemoryUsageTracking
Test Description: Tests memory usage tracking for 2GB limit compliance. Verifies memory increases with voxels and decreases when cleared.

Test Name: SparseOctreeTest.ClusteringEfficiency
Test Description: Tests memory efficiency for clustered vs scattered voxels. Verifies clustered voxels use memory more efficiently than scattered ones.
