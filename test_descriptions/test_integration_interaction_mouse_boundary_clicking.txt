Test Name: CornerClickValidation
Test Description: Tests mouse clicking at all 8 workspace corners with boundary adjustment to ensure voxels can be placed near corners with proper grid snapping.

Test Name: ExactBoundaryClicks
Test Description: Tests clicking exactly on workspace boundaries and validates that clicks slightly inside boundaries succeed.

Test Name: OutsideBoundaryClicks
Test Description: Tests clicking outside workspace boundaries to ensure placement is properly rejected.

Test Name: ResolutionBoundaryBehavior
Test Description: Tests boundary behavior across different voxel resolutions (1cm-32cm) to ensure grid snapping maintains boundary constraints.

Test Name: GroundPlaneConstraint
Test Description: Tests ground plane constraint (Y >= 0) by attempting clicks below ground and verifying proper clamping behavior.
