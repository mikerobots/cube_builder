Test Name: DefaultConstruction
Test Description: Tests default construction of RenderStats ensuring all statistics are initialized to appropriate default values (0 for counts, 1000.0f for minFrameTime, 0.0f for others)

Test Name: UpdateFrameStats
Test Description: Tests frame statistics updates including frame count, frame time, FPS calculation, and min/max frame time tracking across multiple frames with different timings

Test Name: DrawCallTracking
Test Description: Tests draw call tracking for both regular and instanced draw calls, including triangle and vertex counting, and calculation of average triangles per draw call

Test Name: StateChangeTracking
Test Description: Tests tracking of render state changes including general state changes, shader switches, and texture binds

Test Name: CullingStats
Test Description: Tests culling statistics tracking including total objects, rendered objects, culled objects, and culling efficiency calculation with edge case handling for zero objects

Test Name: MemoryStats
Test Description: Tests GPU memory statistics tracking for vertex buffers, index buffers, textures, total GPU memory calculation, and conversion to MB

Test Name: ResourceCounts
Test Description: Tests tracking of active resource counts including shaders, textures, and buffers

Test Name: UtilizationCalculations
Test Description: Tests CPU and GPU utilization percentage calculations based on frame time, with edge case handling for zero frame time

Test Name: AverageFPSCalculation
Test Description: Tests average FPS calculation based on average frame time, including zero frame time edge case

Test Name: ResetOperations
Test Description: Tests reset() method to ensure all per-frame statistics are properly cleared while preserving persistent stats

Test Name: BasicTiming
Test Description: Tests RenderTimer basic timing functionality by measuring elapsed time after a sleep period, with tolerances for system timing variance

Test Name: RestartFunctionality
Test Description: Tests RenderTimer restart() method which returns elapsed time and resets the timer, verifying timing continues correctly after restart
