Test Name: BasicProfiling
Test Description: Tests basic performance profiling functionality with begin/end section timing, verifying call count, total time (â‰¥10ms), and timing statistics calculation.

Test Name: MultipleCalls
Test Description: Validates profiling of repeated section calls (3 iterations), testing cumulative timing statistics, call count tracking, and proper min/max/average time calculations.

Test Name: MultipleSections
Test Description: Tests profiling multiple different sections with varying execution times, verifying proper section separation and results sorting by total time (descending).

Test Name: ScopedProfiler
Test Description: Validates automatic scoped profiling using ScopedProfiler RAII class, testing scope-based timing measurement and automatic cleanup on scope exit.

Test Name: NestedProfiling
Test Description: Tests nested profiling sections with outer/inner timing hierarchy, verifying proper timing isolation and that outer time includes inner execution time.

Test Name: MismatchedSections
Test Description: Validates error handling for mismatched begin/end section names, ensuring invalid profiling attempts result in no recorded sections.

Test Name: MemoryTracking
Test Description: Tests memory allocation/deallocation tracking with category-based organization, verifying allocation counts, byte tracking, and current usage calculations.

Test Name: MultipleMemoryCategories
Test Description: Validates memory tracking across multiple categories, ensuring proper isolation and independent tracking of allocation/deallocation per category.

Test Name: Reset
Test Description: Tests profiler reset functionality, verifying complete clearing of both timing profile data and memory statistics after reset operation.

Test Name: SaveReport
Test Description: Validates profile report generation to file, testing file creation, content verification (timing/memory sections), and proper report formatting with cleanup.

Test Name: Macros
Test Description: Tests PROFILE_SCOPE macro functionality for convenient scoped profiling, verifying automatic section naming and timing measurement.

Test Name: FunctionMacro
Test Description: Validates PROFILE_FUNCTION macro for automatic function profiling, testing function name detection and timing measurement for testFunction.
