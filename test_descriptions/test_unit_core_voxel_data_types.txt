Test Name: VoxelResolutionValues
Test Description: Tests that getVoxelSize function returns correct meter values for each voxel resolution (1cm=0.01f, 2cm=0.02f, 4cm=0.04f, ..., 512cm=5.12f). Validates requirement REQ-5.3.3 for available resolutions.

Test Name: VoxelResolutionNames
Test Description: Tests that getVoxelSizeName function returns correct string names for each voxel resolution (Size_1cm="1cm", Size_16cm="16cm", Size_512cm="512cm").

Test Name: ResolutionValidation
Test Description: Tests the isValidResolution function, verifying that values 0-9 are valid (corresponding to the 10 resolution levels) and values outside this range (-1, 10) are invalid.

Test Name: VoxelPositionConstruction
Test Description: Tests VoxelPosition construction including default construction (zero position, Size_1cm resolution), construction from Vector3i and resolution, and construction from individual coordinates and resolution.

Test Name: WorldSpaceConversion
Test Description: Tests conversion between voxel increment positions and world space coordinates for 1cm voxels, including toWorldSpace conversion and round-trip conversion using fromWorldSpace. Validates requirement REQ-2.2.4 for voxel placement at any valid increment position.

Test Name: WorldSpaceConversionLargerVoxels
Test Description: Tests world space conversion for larger voxels (4cm), verifying that increment position (5,5,5) correctly converts to world position (0.05, 0.05, 0.05) meters in the centered coordinate system.

Test Name: VoxelBounds
Test Description: Tests getWorldBounds function for voxels, verifying correct bounding box calculation where the voxel's bottom face sits on the ground plane (Y=0) and extends appropriately in X,Z directions based on voxel size.

Test Name: VoxelPositionEquality
Test Description: Tests equality and inequality operators for VoxelPosition objects, verifying that positions with identical coordinates and resolution are equal, while positions differing in either coordinate or resolution are not equal.

Test Name: VoxelPositionHash
Test Description: Tests the hash function for VoxelPosition objects, ensuring identical positions produce the same hash value while different positions produce different hash values.

Test Name: WorkspaceConstraints
Test Description: Tests WorkspaceConstraints validation and clamping functions, verifying valid workspace sizes (2m-8m), invalid sizes (<2m or >8m), and proper clamping of out-of-range values to valid bounds.

Test Name: GridDimensionCalculation
Test Description: Tests calculateMaxGridDimensions function for different voxel resolutions, verifying correct grid dimensions based on workspace size (e.g., 5m workspace with 1cm voxels = 500x500x500 grid). Validates requirement REQ-6.2.2 for grid scaling with workspace.

Test Name: Resolution8cmValidation
Test Description: Comprehensive test for 8cm voxel resolution including size verification (0.08f), grid dimension calculation (63x63x63 for 5m workspace), world position conversion, and bounds calculation with placement position as bottom-center.

Test Name: PositionBoundsChecking
Test Description: Tests isPositionInBounds function for various positions, verifying correct boundary checking for centered workspace including valid positions within bounds, positions outside X/Y/Z boundaries, and positions below ground plane (Y<0).
