Test Name: BasicSetDistance
Test Description: Tests basic setDistance functionality verifying distance getter/setter works correctly with various values (10.0f, 2.5f, 50.0f) (REQ-CAM-1, REQ-8.1.5)

Test Name: DistanceConstraints
Test Description: Tests distance clamping to min/max constraints (0.5f-100.0f), verifying values below minimum and above maximum are properly clamped

Test Name: CustomDistanceConstraints
Test Description: Tests setDistanceConstraints() method with custom min/max values (2.0f-20.0f) and verifies current distance is clamped when constraints change

Test Name: EdgeCases
Test Description: Tests edge cases including zero distance, negative distance, very large values, and NaN handling to ensure distance remains valid

Test Name: UpdatesCameraPosition
Test Description: Tests that setDistance updates camera position correctly, verifying position changes proportionally with distance along view axis (REQ-CAM-3)

Test Name: WithDifferentOrientations
Test Description: Tests setDistance with different camera yaw/pitch orientations, verifying camera position updates correctly regardless of orientation

Test Name: RapidSetDistanceCalls
Test Description: Tests rapid sequential setDistance calls to ensure stability and correct behavior under frequent changes

Test Name: PreservesOtherProperties
Test Description: Tests that setDistance preserves other camera properties like yaw, pitch, and target position unchanged

Test Name: WithSmoothingEnabled
Test Description: Tests setDistance behavior with smoothing enabled, verifying immediate distance change for setDistance vs gradual change for zoom()

Test Name: ThroughCameraController
Test Description: Tests setDistance through CameraController's camera instance, verifying constraints still apply

Test Name: ViewMatrixUpdate
Test Description: Tests that changing distance updates the view matrix appropriately for integration with rendering system (REQ-CAM-8)

Test Name: SmallIncrements
Test Description: Tests applying many small distance increments (0.01f) to verify floating-point precision handling

Test Name: AfterViewPresetChange
Test Description: Tests setDistance functionality after changing view presets (FRONT, ISOMETRIC), verifying manual distance control works after preset changes
