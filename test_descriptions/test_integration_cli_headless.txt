Test Name: HeadlessModeInitialization
Test Description: Tests CLI application initializes properly in headless mode with --headless flag, verifying no render window is created while core systems remain available

Test Name: HeadlessVoxelOperations
Test Description: Tests basic voxel operations (place, get, remove) work correctly in headless mode using 8cm aligned coordinates without rendering

Test Name: WorkspaceManagement
Test Description: Tests workspace resizing operations in headless mode including default (5mÂ³), minimum (2m), maximum (8m), invalid sizes, and non-uniform dimensions

Test Name: WorkspaceBoundaryVoxelPlacement
Test Description: Tests voxel placement at workspace boundaries using centered coordinate system with 4m workspace and 8cm voxels, verifying valid/invalid positions

Test Name: MultiResolutionSupport
Test Description: Tests support for multiple voxel resolutions (1cm-256cm) in headless mode, placing voxels at origin for each resolution

Test Name: ResolutionSwitching
Test Description: Tests switching between different resolutions (8cm, 16cm, 32cm) doesn't affect voxels at other resolutions, verifying independent storage

Test Name: BasicSelectionOperations
Test Description: Tests basic selection system operations including individual voxel selection, select all, clear selection with 5x5 grid of test voxels

Test Name: BoxSelection
Test Description: Tests box selection functionality with 5x5x5 cube of voxels using world space bounding box coordinates

Test Name: SphereSelection
Test Description: Tests sphere selection with center point and radius to capture multiple voxels from 5x5x5 test grid

Test Name: BasicFileOperations
Test Description: Tests basic file I/O operations including project save/load with proper error handling for VXL format files

Test Name: MultipleFileOperations
Test Description: Tests multiple save/load cycles with different filenames, verifying error handling and file management across multiple operations

Test Name: InvalidFileOperations
Test Description: Tests file I/O error handling including non-existent files and invalid file formats, ensuring graceful failure with error messages

Test Name: UndoRedoOperations
Test Description: Tests undo/redo system availability and basic functionality including history manager setup and memory limits

Test Name: GroupOperations
Test Description: Tests group management functionality including creating groups from voxel collections, visibility controls, and group listing

Test Name: MultipleGroups
Test Description: Tests creating and managing multiple groups with different voxel sets, verifying group isolation and proper listing

Test Name: LargeVoxelCount
Test Description: Tests performance with large voxel counts (1000 voxels in 10x10x10 grid), measuring placement time and success rate

Test Name: MemoryUsage
Test Description: Tests memory usage tracking and cleanup functionality, verifying memory is properly released after clearing voxels
