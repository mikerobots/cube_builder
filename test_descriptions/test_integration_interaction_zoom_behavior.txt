Test Name: ZoomOnceAndStep
Test Description: Tests exact zoom behavior issue by executing three consecutive 1.5x zoom commands, verifying each reduces distance properly without stepping back

Test Name: MultipleSequentialZooms
Test Description: Tests multiple sequential zoom commands (5 iterations of 1.2x zoom), verifying each zoom reduces distance and applies correct factor

Test Name: AlternatingZoomInOut
Test Description: Tests alternating zoom in (2.0x) and zoom out (0.5x) operations, verifying camera returns to original distance

Test Name: SmallIncrementalZooms
Test Description: Tests many small zoom steps (20 iterations of 1.05x zoom), verifying cumulative effect and floating point precision

Test Name: ZoomAfterOtherOperations
Test Description: Tests zoom behavior after other camera operations (view preset change, rotation), ensuring zoom works correctly from any camera state

Test Name: IdenticalConsecutiveZooms
Test Description: Tests the specific pattern that might cause stepping by executing identical 1.5x zoom factors 5 times with debug logging

Test Name: ZoomFromDifferentDistances
Test Description: Tests zoom behavior from different starting distances (5.0f to 45.0f), verifying consistent zoom factor application

Test Name: FloatingPointPrecision
Test Description: Tests floating point precision issues by starting with 3.333333f distance and applying 10 iterations of 1.1x zoom with precise comparisons
