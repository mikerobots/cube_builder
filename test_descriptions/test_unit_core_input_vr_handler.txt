Test Name: DefaultState
Test Description: Verifies that VRInputHandler initializes with correct default state - no hand tracking, zero positions/orientations, no active gestures, and pointing disabled for both hands.

Test Name: HandTracking
Test Description: Tests hand tracking enable/disable functionality and validates that the system meets VR platform requirements (REQ-7.1.2 for Meta Quest 3, REQ-7.3.2 for OpenXR SDK, REQ-7.3.3 for Meta Hand Tracking SDK).

Test Name: TrackingQuality
Test Description: Validates tracking quality state management, ensuring the handler correctly tracks and reports different quality levels (None, Low, Medium, High).

Test Name: HandPoseUpdate
Test Description: Tests updating hand pose data through VR events, verifying that position, orientation, and confidence values are correctly stored and retrievable for individual hands.

Test Name: BothHandPoses
Test Description: Validates simultaneous tracking of both left and right hand poses, ensuring independent updates and correct retrieval of position and confidence data for each hand.

Test Name: GestureConfiguration
Test Description: Tests gesture enable/disable functionality, verifying default states (Point, Grab, Pinch enabled) and the ability to toggle individual gesture recognition on/off.

Test Name: GestureThresholds
Test Description: Validates gesture detection threshold management, ensuring default thresholds are valid (0-1 range) and custom thresholds can be set and retrieved for different gestures.

Test Name: GestureDetection
Test Description: Tests basic gesture detection event processing, verifying that gesture detected events with hand pose and gesture data are processed without errors.

Test Name: ComfortSettings
Test Description: Validates VR comfort settings management, testing default settings (snap turning, teleport movement) and custom performance-oriented settings configuration.

Test Name: PoseFiltering
Test Description: Tests pose filtering configuration including enable/disable state, filter strength adjustment, and pose history size settings for smooth hand tracking.

Test Name: Sensitivity
Test Description: Validates sensitivity configuration for VR input, testing default value (1.0) and the ability to adjust sensitivity for different interaction styles.

Test Name: EnabledState
Test Description: Tests handler enable/disable functionality, verifying that VR events are ignored when disabled and processed correctly when enabled.

Test Name: VRUtilities
Test Description: Validates utility functions for VR gesture and hand type conversions (to/from string), and validation functions for gesture and hand type enums.

Test Name: GestureQueries
Test Description: Tests gesture query functions including confidence values, gesture positions, and active gesture lists for each hand, verifying correct default values.

Test Name: RayCasting
Test Description: Tests ray casting functionality for pointing gestures, validating hand ray generation, pointing detection based on finger poses, and pointing direction calculation.

Test Name: Update
Test Description: Validates the update loop functionality, ensuring stable state maintenance and proper handling of hand pose data across update cycles.

Test Name: HandLost
Test Description: Tests hand tracking loss detection, verifying that hands with zero confidence are correctly marked as no longer tracking.
