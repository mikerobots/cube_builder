Test Name: VoxelId_DefaultConstruction
Test Description: Tests the default construction of VoxelId objects, verifying that the position defaults to IncrementCoordinates of zero vector and resolution defaults to Size_1cm.

Test Name: VoxelId_ParameterizedConstruction
Test Description: Tests the parameterized construction of VoxelId objects with specific position and resolution values, ensuring both parameters are correctly stored.

Test Name: VoxelId_Equality
Test Description: Tests the equality and inequality operators for VoxelId objects, verifying that voxels with identical position and resolution are equal, while voxels differing in either position or resolution are not equal.

Test Name: VoxelId_Comparison
Test Description: Tests the less-than comparison operator for VoxelId objects, verifying that resolution takes precedence in ordering, followed by position comparison.

Test Name: VoxelId_Hash
Test Description: Tests the hash function for VoxelId objects, ensuring that identical voxels produce the same hash value while different voxels produce different hash values.

Test Name: VoxelId_GetWorldPosition
Test Description: Tests the getWorldPosition method for VoxelId objects at various positions and resolutions, verifying correct world coordinate calculations based on voxel size and position, including proper centering of voxels.

Test Name: VoxelId_GetVoxelSize
Test Description: Tests the getVoxelSize method for all voxel resolutions (1cm through 512cm), verifying that each resolution returns the correct size in meters.

Test Name: VoxelId_GetBounds
Test Description: Tests the getBounds method for VoxelId objects, verifying that the bounding box correctly represents the voxel's minimum and maximum world coordinates based on its position and size.

Test Name: SelectionStats_DefaultConstruction
Test Description: Tests the default construction of SelectionStats objects, verifying all fields are initialized to zero/empty (voxelCount=0, empty countByResolution map, center at origin, totalVolume=0).

Test Name: SelectionStats_Clear
Test Description: Tests the clear method of SelectionStats, verifying that all fields are reset to their default values after being populated with data.

Test Name: SelectionStyle_DefaultValues
Test Description: Tests the default values of SelectionStyle, verifying outline color (green), fill color (semi-transparent green), outline thickness (2.0f), animation settings (enabled, speed 1.0), and display options (showBounds and showCount enabled).

Test Name: SelectionContext_DefaultValues
Test Description: Tests the default values of SelectionContext, verifying mode is Replace, continuous is false, preview is false, and both region and filter are empty optional values.

Test Name: VoxelId_StdHash
Test Description: Tests the std::hash specialization for VoxelId by using an unordered_set, verifying that duplicate voxels are not inserted and different voxels are stored separately, confirming proper hash functionality for STL containers.
