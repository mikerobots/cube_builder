Test Name: GridAtGroundLevel_ViewMatrices
Test Description: Validates that camera view matrices properly transform the Y=0 plane (ground level) and keep it visible from different camera angles (REQ-1.1.2).

Test Name: RayCasting_ScreenToWorld
Test Description: Tests ray generation from screen coordinates to world space, verifying normalized direction vectors and valid ray properties without NaN values (REQ-5.1.4).

Test Name: ViewIndependence_AllAngles
Test Description: Verifies that highlights remain visible from multiple camera angles (front, right, back, left, elevated) by checking depth ordering in view space (REQ-4.2.3).

Test Name: StatePersistence_Serialization
Test Description: Tests camera state serialization and restoration, ensuring distance, yaw, pitch, and target position can be persisted and restored accurately (REQ-8.1.5).

Test Name: CLICommands_CameraControl
Test Description: Validates CLI camera command functionality including zoom in/out, view preset selection (front, top), and orbit rotation commands (REQ-9.2.2).

Test Name: OrbitControls_Implementation
Test Description: Tests orbit-style camera controls, verifying that camera maintains constant distance from target while rotating around it (REQ-CAM-1).

Test Name: ViewProjections_Support
Test Description: Validates support for multiple view projections, testing perspective projection matrices and proper handling of different aspect ratios (REQ-CAM-2).

Test Name: CoordinateSystem_Consistency
Test Description: Verifies consistent centered coordinate system with Y-up orientation, proper handling of negative coordinates, and origin at (0,0,0) (REQ-CAM-3).

Test Name: ViewPresets_AllDirections
Test Description: Tests all standard view presets (front, back, left, right, top, bottom, isometric) can be set without errors and produce valid camera states (REQ-CAM-4).

Test Name: ViewTransitions_Smoothness
Test Description: Validates smooth view transitions between presets when smoothing is enabled, ensuring camera doesn't jump instantly between positions (REQ-CAM-5).

Test Name: RayGeneration_Accuracy
Test Description: Tests accurate ray generation through screen center, verifying correct intersection with Y=0 plane and reasonable hit point accuracy (REQ-CAM-6).

Test Name: Performance_Operations
Test Description: Measures performance of camera operations, ensuring view/projection matrix calculations average < 1ms and ray generation averages < 0.1ms (REQ-CAM-7).

Test Name: Integration_EventSystem
Test Description: Validates camera integration with other subsystems, verifying proper matrix generation and state change functionality (REQ-CAM-8).

Test Name: CameraBounds_Constraints
Test Description: Tests camera bounds and constraints including minimum/maximum distance limits (0.5-100 units) and pitch constraints (-90 to 90 degrees) to prevent gimbal lock.
