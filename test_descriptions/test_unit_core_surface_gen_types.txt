Test Name: MeshTest.DefaultConstruction
Test Description: Tests the default construction of Mesh objects, verifying all containers are empty (vertices, normals, uvCoords, indices), materialId is 0, and that an empty mesh is considered valid. Validates requirement REQ-10.1.1 for Dual Contouring algorithm output structure.

Test Name: MeshTest.IsValid
Test Description: Tests the isValid method of Mesh objects, verifying that empty meshes are valid, meshes with only vertices are valid, meshes with valid indices are valid, meshes with out-of-bounds indices are invalid, and meshes with non-multiple-of-3 indices are invalid. Validates requirement REQ-8.2.1 for STL export validation.

Test Name: MeshTest.Clear
Test Description: Tests the clear method of Mesh objects, verifying that all data (vertices, normals, uvCoords, indices, materialId) is properly cleared and the mesh remains valid after clearing. Validates requirement REQ-10.1.5 for real-time preview mesh regeneration.

Test Name: MeshTest.GetMemoryUsage
Test Description: Tests memory usage calculation for Mesh objects, verifying empty mesh size equals sizeof(Mesh), memory increases when adding vertices, and further increases when adding normals, uvCoords, and indices. Validates requirement REQ-6.3.1 for memory constraint compliance.

Test Name: MeshTest.Transform
Test Description: Tests the transform method of Mesh objects, verifying that vertices are correctly transformed by a translation matrix while normals remain unchanged (as they represent directions, not positions).

Test Name: SurfaceSettingsTest.DefaultSettings
Test Description: Tests the Default factory method for SurfaceSettings, verifying default values including adaptiveError=0.01f, generateNormals=true, generateUVs=false, smoothingIterations=0, simplificationRatio=1.0f, preserveSharpFeatures=true, and sharpFeatureAngle=30.0f.

Test Name: SurfaceSettingsTest.PreviewSettings
Test Description: Tests the Preview factory method for SurfaceSettings, verifying optimized preview values including adaptiveError=0.05f (less precise), generateNormals=false, simplificationRatio=0.5f (half the triangles), and preserveSharpFeatures=false for faster generation.

Test Name: SurfaceSettingsTest.ExportSettings
Test Description: Tests the Export factory method for SurfaceSettings, verifying high-quality export values including adaptiveError=0.001f (very precise), generateNormals=true, generateUVs=true, smoothingIterations=2, simplificationRatio=0.95f, and sharpFeatureAngle=45.0f.

Test Name: SurfaceSettingsTest.EqualityOperator
Test Description: Tests the equality and inequality operators for SurfaceSettings, verifying that identical settings are equal, different presets are not equal, and modifying any field makes settings unequal.

Test Name: SurfaceSettingsTest.HashFunction
Test Description: Tests the hash function for SurfaceSettings, verifying that identical settings produce the same hash value, different presets produce different hashes, and modified settings produce different hashes.

Test Name: MeshGenerationEventTest.Construction
Test Description: Tests the construction of MeshGenerationEvent objects, verifying default values including the specified event type, progress=0.0f, empty message, and lodLevel=LOD0.

Test Name: SimplificationSettingsTest.Presets
Test Description: Tests the factory methods for SimplificationSettings presets, verifying Aggressive settings (targetRatio=0.25f, no topology/boundary preservation), Balanced settings (targetRatio=0.5f, preserve both), and Conservative settings (targetRatio=0.75f, preserve both).

Test Name: MeshCacheEntryTest.UpdateAccess
Test Description: Tests the updateAccess method of MeshCacheEntry, verifying that calling it updates the lastAccess timestamp to a later time than the initial value.

Test Name: LODLevelTest.Conversion
Test Description: Tests the conversion between LODLevel enum values and integers, verifying that LOD levels 0-4 correctly convert to and from their integer representations.

Test Name: ExportQualityTest.Values
Test Description: Tests that ExportQuality enum values (Draft, Standard, High, Maximum) have distinct integer values, ensuring they can be properly distinguished in quality selection logic.
