Test Name: BasicInitialization
Test Description: Tests application initialization in headless mode, verifying all core systems (VoxelManager, CameraController, InputManager, SelectionManager, HistoryManager, SurfaceGenerator, GroupManager, FileManager) are properly created and accessible.

Test Name: VoxelPlacementWorkflow
Test Description: Tests complete voxel placement workflow with 8cm resolution at arbitrary 1cm positions (0,0,0), (3,0,1), (1,7,2), verifying the new requirement that large voxels can be placed at any centimeter increment.

Test Name: ArbitraryPositionPlacement
Test Description: Validates new requirement allowing 16cm voxels at non-aligned positions, testing placement at (1,0,1), (25,0,1), (1,0,25), (45,0,45) without overlap and verifying exact position placement without snapping.

Test Name: SelectionWorkflow
Test Description: Tests selection system workflow with 8cm voxels, placing 5x5 grid, selecting 3x3 subset, verifying selection counts, and testing selectNone/selectAll functionality.

Test Name: GroupManagementWorkflow
Test Description: Tests group management system by creating voxels, selecting them, creating named group "TestGroup", verifying group properties (name, voxel count), and testing visibility controls.

Test Name: CameraControlWorkflow
Test Description: Tests camera control functionality including camera access, distance manipulation (zoom), orbital rotation, and verification that camera settings persist through transformations.

Test Name: UndoRedoWorkflow
Test Description: Basic test of voxel placement and removal workflow, laying groundwork for future undo/redo system implementation with voxel state management.

Test Name: FileIOWorkflow
Test Description: Tests file I/O system with project creation, metadata setting (name, description, author), saving to test_project.cvef, loading, and verifying project integrity and metadata preservation.

Test Name: WorkspaceResizing
Test Description: Tests workspace resizing functionality, verifying default 5m³ size, successful resize to 8m³, and validation rejection of too-small workspace dimensions (1m³).

Test Name: MultiResolutionSupport
Test Description: Tests multi-resolution voxel support by placing voxels at different resolutions (1cm, 8cm, 64cm) with proper alignment, verifying individual voxel existence and total count across all resolutions.
