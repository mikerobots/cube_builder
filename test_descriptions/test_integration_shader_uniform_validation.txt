Test Name: ModelViewProjectionMatrices
Test Description: Tests shader uniform handling for model, view, and projection matrices with different transformations (identity, translation, rotation, scale)

Test Name: CameraPositionAffectsLighting
Test Description: Validates that camera position changes affect lighting calculations by testing different camera positions and measuring brightness variations

Test Name: LightDirectionChanges
Test Description: Tests that different light directions produce different lighting effects by rendering with various light directions and analyzing brightness patterns

Test Name: MaterialProperties
Test Description: Tests material property uniforms (ambient, diffuse, specular, shininess) if supported by enhanced shaders - currently skipped as enhanced_voxel shader lacks material uniform support

Test Name: UniformUpdatePerformance
Test Description: Performance test for rapid uniform updates measuring the time to update 1000 uniform values and validating performance stays under 100 microseconds per update

Test Name: VoxelCubeCreation
Test Description: Helper test that creates a complete voxel cube mesh with proper vertex attributes (position, normal, color) and OpenGL buffer setup

Test Name: FramebufferCapture
Test Description: Tests framebuffer pixel capture functionality for visual validation and brightness analysis

Test Name: ShaderUniformSetting
Test Description: Tests setting various shader uniforms including matrices, vectors, and lighting parameters with proper type conversion

Test Name: OpenGLBufferManagement
Test Description: Validates proper creation, binding, and cleanup of OpenGL vertex array objects, vertex buffers, and element buffers

Test Name: PixelAnalysisValidation
Test Description: Tests pixel-based validation helpers for color distribution analysis and brightness measurement in rendered output
