Test Name: VoxelGridTest.ConstructionWithValidParameters
Test Description: Tests VoxelGrid construction with valid parameters. Verifies resolution, workspace size, initial voxel count, memory usage, and grid dimensions covering entire workspace.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.ConstructionWithDifferentResolutions
Test Description: Tests VoxelGrid construction with all 10 resolution levels. Verifies each resolution correctly initializes with proper voxel size and empty state.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.BasicVoxelOperations
Test Description: Tests basic voxel set/get operations using grid coordinates. Verifies voxels can be placed, retrieved, counted, and removed correctly.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.WorldSpaceOperations
Test Description: Tests voxel operations using world space coordinates. Verifies world position placement and retrieval work with coordinate conversion.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.GridWorldCoordinateConversion
Test Description: Tests coordinate conversion between increment and world coordinates. Verifies centered coordinate system with origin at (0,0,0) and round-trip conversion accuracy.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.PositionValidation
Test Description: Tests position validation for increment and world coordinates. Verifies workspace bounds enforcement and Y>=0 constraint for both coordinate types.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.OutOfBoundsOperations
Test Description: Tests operations outside workspace bounds fail gracefully. Verifies out-of-bounds set/get operations return false and don't create voxels.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.WorkspaceResizing
Test Description: Tests workspace resizing functionality. Verifies grid can be resized to larger/smaller workspaces with optional voxel preservation.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.ClearOperation
Test Description: Tests clearing all voxels from grid. Verifies clear removes all voxels, resets count to zero, and reduces memory usage.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.MemoryOptimization
Test Description: Tests memory optimization functionality. Verifies optimize preserves voxel count and accessibility while potentially reducing memory usage.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.VoxelExport
Test Description: Tests exporting all voxels as a list. Verifies getAllVoxels returns correct positions and resolutions for all stored voxels.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.DifferentResolutionBehavior
Test Description: Tests that different resolution grids use same coordinate system. Verifies all grids have same dimensions and coordinate mappings regardless of voxel size.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.StressTestLargeGrid
Test Description: Tests large-scale voxel storage with 8m workspace. Verifies grid can handle thousands of voxels efficiently with correct retrieval.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.MemoryUsageScaling
Test Description: Tests memory usage scales appropriately with voxel count. Verifies memory increases when adding voxels and decreases when clearing.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.ThreadSafetyPreparation
Test Description: Tests rapid voxel operations simulating multi-threaded usage. Verifies grid handles rapid set/clear operations correctly maintaining consistency.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.VoxelWorldPositionVerification
Test Description: Tests voxel world position accuracy for rendering. Verifies increment coordinates map to expected world positions with proper round-trip conversion.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.ArbitraryPositions_NoSnapToVoxelBoundaries
Test Description: Tests voxels can be stored at any 1cm position without resolution-based snapping. Verifies new requirement allows non-aligned positions for all voxel sizes.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.ArbitraryPositions_AllResolutionsSupported
Test Description: Tests all voxel resolutions support arbitrary 1cm positions. Verifies no resolution enforces grid alignment, supporting exact placement.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.ArbitraryPositions_StorageAndRetrieval
Test Description: Tests storage and retrieval at arbitrary positions. Verifies voxels stored at non-aligned positions can be retrieved correctly.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.ArbitraryPositions_GridCoordinateMapping
Test Description: Tests increment-to-grid coordinate mapping without snapping. Verifies internal grid coordinates preserve 1cm granularity for all resolutions.

Test Name: VoxelGridTest.ArbitraryPositions_DensePacking
Test Description: Tests dense storage at 1cm intervals. Verifies sparse octree efficiently handles many voxels at arbitrary positions with reasonable memory usage.
