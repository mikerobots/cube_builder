Test Name: BasicShaderPhongLighting
Test Description: Tests Phong lighting implementation in the basic_voxel shader by rendering a white cube with lights positioned at different angles (top-front, top-left, bottom-right, top-back). Validates brightness variation, highlights, and shadows to ensure proper lighting calculations.

Test Name: EnhancedShaderLighting
Test Description: Tests enhanced_voxel shader lighting capabilities using a cyan cube. Validates that enhanced lighting produces significant brightness variation and maintains good contrast between light and shadow areas. Skips if enhanced shader is unavailable.

Test Name: FlatShaderNoInterpolation
Test Description: Tests flat shading characteristics by rendering a yellow cube with rotation to show multiple faces. Analyzes brightness histogram to detect distinct brightness levels per face and validates that flat shading produces less smooth variation than Phong shading.

Test Name: FaceOrientationBrightness
Test Description: Tests how different cube face orientations (front, right, top, back) affect lighting brightness with a fixed light position. Validates that all visible faces receive illumination and checks for brightness variation between different orientations, accounting for back-face culling.
