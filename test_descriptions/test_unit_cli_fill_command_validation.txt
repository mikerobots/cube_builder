Test Name: GroundPlaneViolation_NegativeY1
Test Description: Tests ground plane constraint enforcement by attempting to place voxels at Y=-1cm (below ground), verifying setVoxel fails and no voxels exist at invalid Y positions.

Test Name: GroundPlaneViolation_NegativeY2
Test Description: Validates ground plane violation handling for Y=-50cm coordinates, testing VoxelDataManager rejection of voxel placement below ground plane.

Test Name: GroundPlaneViolation_BothYNegative
Test Description: Tests multiple negative Y positions (-200cm to -1cm), verifying ground plane constraint prevents all voxel placement below Y=0 across various coordinates.

Test Name: GroundPlaneValid_YAtZero
Test Description: Validates that Y=0 (exactly on ground plane) is valid for voxel placement, testing ground level placement succeeds and voxel exists.

Test Name: GroundPlaneValid_YAboveZero
Test Description: Tests valid Y positions above ground plane (1cm, 100cm, 200cm, 250cm), verifying voxel placement succeeds for all coordinates Y>0.

Test Name: GroundPlaneViolation_DifferentResolutions
Test Description: Validates ground plane constraint across multiple voxel resolutions (1cm, 4cm, 16cm, 64cm, 256cm), ensuring Y<0 violations are prevented regardless of voxel size.

Test Name: FillCommand_GroundPlaneViolation_FullCommandExecution_REQ_11_3_10
Test Description: Tests complete CLI fill command pipeline with Y<0 coordinates, verifying no voxels are placed below ground plane even if command parsing succeeds.

Test Name: FillCommand_GroundPlaneViolation_BothCoordinatesNegative_REQ_11_3_10
Test Description: Tests CLI fill command with both Y coordinates negative (-200cm to -100cm), verifying no voxels are placed anywhere when entire region is below ground.

Test Name: DISABLED_FillCommand_GroundPlaneValid_MixedYCoordinates_REQ_11_3_10
Test Description: Tests fill command spanning below/above ground (Y=-50cm to Y=50cm), verifying no voxels below Y=0 but valid voxels exist at Yâ‰¥0.

Test Name: DISABLED_VoxelFillCommand_DirectExecution_GroundPlaneViolation_REQ_11_3_10
Test Description: Tests VoxelFillCommand directly with ground plane violations, verifying undo/redo functionality and proper constraint enforcement in fill operations.

Test Name: CoordinateAlignment_1cmResolution_REQ_11_3_11
Test Description: Tests fill command coordinate alignment to 1cm resolution grid (0cm to 3cm region), verifying voxels are placed at expected integer cm positions.

Test Name: CoordinateAlignment_4cmResolution_REQ_11_3_11
Test Description: Validates coordinate alignment to 4cm resolution grid (0cm to 12cm region), testing voxel placement at 4cm increment positions in world coordinates.

Test Name: CoordinateAlignment_32cmResolution_REQ_11_3_11
Test Description: Tests coordinate alignment to 64cm resolution grid (0cm to 128cm region), verifying voxel placement at 64cm increment positions despite test name referencing 32cm.

Test Name: DISABLED_CoordinateAlignment_MisalignedCoordinates_REQ_11_3_11
Test Description: Tests fill command with misaligned coordinates (1.5cm to 9.7cm) on 4cm grid, verifying floor/ceil operations handle non-aligned input coordinates correctly.

Test Name: CoordinateAlignment_AllResolutions_REQ_11_3_11
Test Description: Comprehensive test of coordinate alignment across all resolutions (1cm, 4cm, 16cm, 64cm, 256cm), verifying origin and corner voxel placement for each resolution.

Test Name: CoordinateAlignment_NegativeCoordinates_REQ_11_3_11
Test Description: Tests coordinate alignment with negative X/Z coordinates but positive Y coordinates (-16cm to +16cm), verifying proper alignment while respecting ground plane constraint.
