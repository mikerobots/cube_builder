Test Name: RayOriginMatchesCameraPosition
Test Description: Tests that mouse ray origin matches camera position, verifying ray casting starts from correct world coordinates

Test Name: RayDirectionChangesWithMouseMovement
Test Description: Tests that ray direction changes appropriately as mouse moves across screen, validating screen-to-world coordinate transformation

Test Name: RayDirectionIsNormalized
Test Description: Tests that generated ray directions are properly normalized vectors, ensuring consistent ray mathematics

Test Name: ConsistentRayForSameMousePosition
Test Description: Tests that identical mouse positions generate consistent rays, verifying deterministic ray generation

Test Name: CameraMovementUpdatesRayOrigin
Test Description: Tests that camera movement properly updates ray origin for mouse ray casting, ensuring spatial consistency

Test Name: ScreenCenterRayPointsForward
Test Description: Tests that mouse ray from screen center points in camera's forward direction, validating coordinate system alignment

Test Name: MouseAtCornersProducesExpectedRays
Test Description: Tests that mouse positions at screen corners produce expected ray directions, verifying viewport bounds behavior

Test Name: ExtremeMousePositionsProduceValidRays
Test Description: Tests that extreme mouse positions (including outside viewport) produce valid normalized rays without errors
