Test Name: SetAndGetUniforms
Test Description: Tests setting and retrieving shader uniforms including matrix uniforms (model, view, projection), verifying uniform locations are found and values are correctly set using OpenGL queries

Test Name: OldUniformNameCompatibility
Test Description: Tests compatibility with old uniform naming convention (u_model, u_view, u_projection, u_color) ensuring backwards compatibility with older shaders

Test Name: VariousUniformTypes
Test Description: Tests setting various uniform types including float (brightness), vec3 (lightDir), int (useTexture), and vec4/color uniforms with verification through OpenGL queries

Test Name: UniformLocationCaching
Test Description: Tests that uniform locations are cached in ProgramInfo after first query, ensuring multiple getUniformLocation calls return the same cached value

Test Name: InvalidUniformHandling
Test Description: Tests error handling for invalid uniforms including non-existent uniform names (returns -1), invalid program IDs, and null program handling without crashes

Test Name: ProgramSpecificVsCurrentProgram
Test Description: Tests setting uniforms on specific programs vs current program, verifying setUniform with program ID temporarily binds that program
