----- File: tests/integration/test_integration_interaction_mouse_ground_plane_clicking.cpp

Test Name: ClickGroundPlaneAtOrigin
Test Description: Tests mouse clicking on ground plane at workspace center (origin) with proper ray-casting simulation.

Test Name: ClickGroundPlaneMultiplePositions
Test Description: Tests clicking at multiple non-overlapping positions on ground plane with 8cm voxels and exact positioning.

Test Name: ClickNearExistingVoxel
Test Description: Tests clicking near existing voxels to validate proper adjacent placement without overlap.

Test Name: GroundPlaneYConstraint
Test Description: Tests ground plane constraint enforcement during mouse clicking with ray-based interaction.

Test Name: WorkspaceBoundaryConstraints
Test Description: Tests workspace boundary validation during mouse clicking, ensuring out-of-bounds clicks are rejected.

Test Name: UndoRedoGroundPlanePlacement
Test Description: Tests undo/redo functionality with mouse-based ground plane voxel placement operations.
