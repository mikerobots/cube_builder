Test Name: SameResolutionOverlapPrevention
Test Description: Tests overlap prevention between voxels of the same resolution, including redundant operations and placement validation with new non-snapping requirements.

Test Name: DifferentResolutionOverlapPrevention
Test Description: Tests overlap prevention between voxels of different resolutions (16cm vs 1cm) with proper boundary checking.

Test Name: ComplexOverlapScenario
Test Description: Tests complex overlap scenarios with multiple voxels in patterns to validate comprehensive overlap detection.

Test Name: RedundantOperationHandling
Test Description: Tests handling of redundant voxel placement and removal operations to ensure they succeed without side effects.

Test Name: WorldSpaceOverlapDetection
Test Description: Tests overlap detection using world space coordinates with setVoxelAtWorldPos method.

Test Name: PlacementValidationOrder
Test Description: Tests that placement validation occurs in proper order (Y constraint before overlap check) for invalid positions.
