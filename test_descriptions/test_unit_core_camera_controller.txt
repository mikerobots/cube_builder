Test Name: DefaultConstruction
Test Description: Tests default construction of CameraController verifying camera, viewport creation and initial interaction mode is NONE

Test Name: ViewportManagement
Test Description: Tests viewport size and bounds management including setViewportSize() and setViewportBounds() with aspect ratio updates

Test Name: MouseButtonInteraction
Test Description: Tests mouse button interactions for orbit (left), pan (middle), and zoom (right) modes (REQ-CAM-1, REQ-9.2.2)

Test Name: MouseButtonOutsideViewport
Test Description: Tests that mouse clicks outside viewport do not start camera interaction

Test Name: MouseDragThreshold
Test Description: Tests mouse drag threshold behavior ensuring small movements don't trigger interaction until threshold is exceeded

Test Name: OrbitControl
Test Description: Tests orbit camera control with mouse movement changing yaw and pitch angles

Test Name: PanControl
Test Description: Tests pan camera control with middle mouse button changing camera target position

Test Name: ZoomControl
Test Description: Tests zoom control with right mouse button changing camera distance

Test Name: MouseWheelZoom
Test Description: Tests mouse wheel zoom functionality with positive delta zooming in and negative delta zooming out

Test Name: MouseWheelOutsideViewport
Test Description: Tests that mouse wheel events outside viewport are ignored

Test Name: ViewPresets
Test Description: Tests camera view presets (FRONT, TOP, ISOMETRIC) setting correct yaw/pitch angles (REQ-CAM-4, REQ-9.2.2)

Test Name: FrameAll
Test Description: Tests frameAll() method centers camera on bounding box center with appropriate distance

Test Name: FocusOn
Test Description: Tests focusOn() method sets camera target and optional distance correctly

Test Name: MouseRayGeneration
Test Description: Tests mouse ray generation for ray-casting with normalized direction vectors (REQ-5.1.4, REQ-CAM-6)

Test Name: WorldToScreen
Test Description: Tests world to screen coordinate conversion with target point projecting near viewport center

Test Name: UpdateAnimation
Test Description: Tests camera animation update with smoothing enabled for smooth transitions (REQ-CAM-5, REQ-CAM-7)

Test Name: SensitivitySettings
Test Description: Tests setCameraSensitivity() configures pan, rotate, and zoom sensitivity values

Test Name: SmoothingSettings
Test Description: Tests setCameraSmoothing() enables/disables smoothing with configurable smooth factor

Test Name: ConstraintSettings
Test Description: Tests setCameraConstraints() sets distance and pitch angle limits

Test Name: DragThresholdSettings
Test Description: Tests setMouseDragThreshold() configuration

Test Name: MouseMoveOutsideViewport
Test Description: Tests mouse movement outside viewport during interaction maintains mode but stops active interaction

Test Name: MultipleMouseButtons
Test Description: Tests multiple simultaneous mouse button presses with later buttons overriding earlier ones

Test Name: InvalidMouseButton
Test Description: Tests invalid mouse button numbers are ignored and don't change interaction mode

Test Name: ContinuousMouseMovement
Test Description: Tests continuous mouse movements accumulate to significant camera angle changes

Test Name: ZeroMouseMovement
Test Description: Tests zero mouse movement doesn't trigger interaction or camera changes
