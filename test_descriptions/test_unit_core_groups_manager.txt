Test Name: GroupManagerTest.CreateGroup
Test Description: Tests basic group creation with a name. Verifies group is created with valid ID, correct name, and exists in the manager.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.CreateGroupWithVoxels
Test Description: Tests creating a group with initial voxels. Verifies group contains specified voxels and voxel-to-group mapping is established.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.DeleteGroup
Test Description: Tests group deletion functionality. Verifies group is removed from manager and attempting to delete non-existent group returns false.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.RenameGroup
Test Description: Tests renaming an existing group. Verifies group name is updated while maintaining the same group ID.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.VoxelMembership
Test Description: Tests voxel membership in multiple groups. Verifies voxels can belong to multiple groups and membership queries work correctly.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.GroupVisibility
Test Description: Tests group hide/show operations. Verifies groups default to visible and visibility state can be toggled with proper tracking.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.GroupOpacity
Test Description: Tests group opacity control for visual indicators. Verifies default opacity is 1.0 and can be adjusted for transparency effects.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.GroupColor
Test Description: Tests group color assignment for visual distinction. Verifies groups get assigned palette colors by default and custom colors can be set.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.GroupLocking
Test Description: Tests group locking to prevent modifications. Verifies groups default to unlocked and lock state can be toggled.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.GroupHierarchy
Test Description: Tests nested group hierarchy support. Verifies parent-child relationships can be established and queried for hierarchical organization.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.GroupQueries
Test Description: Tests various group query operations. Verifies finding groups by name, predicate-based searches, and locked group queries work correctly.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.GroupStatistics
Test Description: Tests group statistics tracking for memory monitoring. Verifies total groups, voxels, max/average group sizes are calculated correctly.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.GroupIteration
Test Description: Tests iterating over groups and hierarchies. Verifies forEach operations visit all groups including hierarchical traversal.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.GroupBounds
Test Description: Tests bounding box calculation for groups. Verifies bounds correctly encompass all voxels with proper coordinate conversions.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.CleanupEmptyGroups
Test Description: Tests automatic removal of empty groups. Verifies cleanup removes groups without voxels while preserving non-empty groups.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.ExportImport
Test Description: Tests group data export/import for persistence. Verifies complete group structure including hierarchy, properties, and voxel membership is preserved.

Test Name: GroupManagerTest.Validation
Test Description: Tests group structure validation. Verifies valid group configurations pass validation checks.
