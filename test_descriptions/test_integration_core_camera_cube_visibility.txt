Test Name: SingleVoxelAtOrigin_FrontCamera
Test Description: Tests single 8cm voxel at origin (0,0,0) is visible from front camera position, validating both point and cube frustum intersection

Test Name: VoxelGrid3x3x3_IsometricCamera
Test Description: Tests 3x3x3 grid of 16cm voxels (positions 3-5 in each axis) are all visible from isometric camera view, expecting all 27 voxels in frustum

Test Name: LargeVoxel_CloseCamera
Test Description: Tests 32cm voxel visibility when camera is positioned very close (distance 1.0f), ensuring large voxels remain visible at close range

Test Name: VoxelBehindCamera
Test Description: Tests voxel at grid position (80,80,80) is not visible when positioned behind camera looking from (5,5,5) towards (0,0,0)

Test Name: VoxelRayIntersection
Test Description: Tests ray-cube intersection from camera through viewport center to 16cm voxel, validating ray-AABB intersection algorithm and frustum visibility

Test Name: MultipleVoxelsScreenCoverage
Test Description: Tests 5 voxels arranged in cross pattern (center, left, right, top, bottom) project to correct screen coordinates within viewport bounds

Test Name: ExplicitMatrixCalculations
Test Description: Tests detailed transform pipeline from world to NDC space for voxel at (6,6,6), manually calculating and verifying view matrix basis vectors and transformations
