Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.MoveGroupOperation
Test Description: Tests moving a group of voxels to a new position. Currently skipped due to infinite loop issue in VoxelDataManager integration.

Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.CopyGroupOperation
Test Description: Tests copying/duplicating a group of voxels. Currently skipped due to infinite loop issue in VoxelDataManager integration.

Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.RotateGroupOperation
Test Description: Tests rotating a group of voxels around a pivot point. Currently skipped due to infinite loop issue in VoxelDataManager integration.

Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.ScaleGroupOperation
Test Description: Tests scaling a group of voxels from a pivot point. Currently skipped due to infinite loop issue in VoxelDataManager integration.

Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.MergeGroupsOperation
Test Description: Tests merging multiple groups into a single group. Currently skipped due to infinite loop issue in VoxelDataManager integration.

Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.SplitGroupOperation
Test Description: Tests splitting a group into multiple groups. Currently skipped due to infinite loop issue in VoxelDataManager integration.

Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.GroupOperationUtils_TransformVoxel
Test Description: Tests transforming a single voxel with translation. Verifies that a 1-meter translation correctly moves the voxel by 100 increment units in the coordinate system.

Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.GroupOperationUtils_CalculateBounds
Test Description: Tests calculating bounding box for a set of voxels. Verifies bounds correctly encompass voxels at different positions including negative coordinates in the centered coordinate system.

Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.GroupOperationUtils_CalculateOptimalPivot
Test Description: Tests calculating optimal pivot point for group operations. Verifies pivot is calculated as the average center of all voxels in world coordinates.

Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.GroupOperationUtils_ValidateVoxelPositions
Test Description: Tests validating voxel positions against workspace bounds. Verifies that voxels within bounds pass validation while those outside bounds fail, supporting memory constraints.

Test Name: GroupOperationsTest.GroupOperationUtils_GenerateUniqueName
Test Description: Tests generating unique names for groups avoiding conflicts. Verifies unique names are generated by appending numbers when duplicates exist in the provided list.
