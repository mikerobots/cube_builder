Test Name: SameSizeVoxelAutomaticEdgeAlignment
Test Description: Tests automatic edge alignment for same-size voxels placed via face detection across multiple resolutions and all 6 faces.

Test Name: EdgeAlignmentIndependentOfBasePosition
Test Description: Tests that edge alignment works correctly regardless of the base voxel's position in the workspace.

Test Name: PerfectlyAlignedVoxelChain
Test Description: Tests creation of a chain of perfectly aligned voxels using face detection to ensure consistent alignment.

Test Name: AlignmentWorksForAllVoxelSizes
Test Description: Tests that edge alignment functionality works correctly for all supported voxel sizes (1cm-64cm).
