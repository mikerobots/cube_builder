Test Name: PreviewMeshGeneration_Optimized
Test Description: Optimized preview mesh generation test using smaller grids (4x4x4) and testing only 2 LOD levels (0 and 4) instead of all 5, targeting <2 seconds runtime

Test Name: ExportMeshGeneration_Optimized
Test Description: Optimized export mesh generation test using only Draft and Maximum quality levels instead of all four, with smaller test data for faster execution

Test Name: BasicGeneration_Fast
Test Description: Fast basic surface generation test using simplified settings (no UVs, no normals, no smoothing) and smaller voxel grid for quick validation

Note: This file contains optimization suggestions for test_unit_core_surface_gen_generator.cpp including:
- Reducing test grid size from 8x8x8 to 4x4x4 (8x reduction)
- Using simplified surface settings without post-processing
- Testing fewer parameter combinations
- Mocking expensive operations with MockSurfaceGenerator
- Moving integration tests to separate suite
- Adding test categorization for selective running
- Expected improvement: 48s to ~10s for essential unit tests
