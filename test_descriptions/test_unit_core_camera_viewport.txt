Test Name: DefaultConstruction
Test Description: Tests default construction of Viewport with expected default values (position at 0,0, size 800x600, aspect ratio calculation)

Test Name: CustomConstruction
Test Description: Tests custom construction of Viewport with specified position (100,50) and size (800x600), verifying all parameters are set correctly

Test Name: PositionManagement
Test Description: Tests viewport position management including setPosition() method and position getter methods

Test Name: SizeManagement
Test Description: Tests viewport size management including setSize() method, aspect ratio updates, and validation that invalid sizes (0, negative) are rejected

Test Name: BoundsManagement
Test Description: Tests setBounds() method which sets both position and size simultaneously

Test Name: ScreenToNormalizedCoordinates
Test Description: Tests conversion from screen coordinates to normalized device coordinates (-1 to 1), testing center, corners, and various points

Test Name: NormalizedToScreenCoordinates
Test Description: Tests conversion from normalized device coordinates (-1 to 1) to screen coordinates, testing center and corner points

Test Name: CoordinateRoundTrip
Test Description: Tests that converting screen coordinates to normalized and back to screen gives the original coordinates

Test Name: ContainsPoint
Test Description: Tests the contains() method to check if a point is inside the viewport boundaries, testing both inside and outside points including edge cases

Test Name: ScreenToWorldRay
Test Description: Tests ray generation from screen coordinates for ray-casting, validates ray direction and normalization (REQ-5.1.4, REQ-CAM-6)

Test Name: WorldToScreen
Test Description: Tests projection of 3D world points to 2D screen coordinates using view and projection matrices

Test Name: MouseDelta
Test Description: Tests calculation of normalized mouse delta movement between two screen positions

Test Name: ZoomFactor
Test Description: Tests zoom factor calculation based on viewport size (min dimension / 800)

Test Name: AspectRatioUpdates
Test Description: Tests aspect ratio calculations for various viewport sizes (square, wide, tall) supporting multiple view projections (REQ-CAM-2)

Test Name: EdgeCaseCoordinates
Test Description: Tests viewport boundary conditions with coordinates exactly at edges and just outside boundaries

Test Name: SmallViewport
Test Description: Tests behavior with very small viewport (1x1 pixel) including aspect ratio and contains() functionality
