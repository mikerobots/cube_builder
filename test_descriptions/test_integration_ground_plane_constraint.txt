Test Name: IncrementCoordinateYConstraint
Test Description: Tests ground plane constraint (Y >= 0) using increment coordinates, validating rejection of Y < 0 positions.

Test Name: WorldCoordinateYConstraint
Test Description: Tests ground plane constraint using world coordinates with setVoxelAtWorldPos method.

Test Name: MultipleResolutionYConstraint
Test Description: Tests Y constraint enforcement across different voxel resolutions (1cm-64cm) ensuring all sizes respect ground plane.

Test Name: VoxelBottomAtGroundPlane
Test Description: Tests that voxels can sit exactly on ground plane with bottom at Y=0 and validates world bounds calculation.

Test Name: EdgeCaseNearZero
Test Description: Tests edge cases near Y=0 with floating point precision, including very small negative and positive values.

Test Name: CombinedConstraints
Test Description: Tests Y constraint combined with other constraints (overlap, bounds) to ensure Y validation occurs first.
