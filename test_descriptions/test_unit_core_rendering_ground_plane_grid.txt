Test Name: DISABLED_Initialize
Test Description: Tests GroundPlaneGrid initialization ensuring grid initializes successfully and is visible by default (disabled due to OpenGL context requirement)

Test Name: GridCellSize
Test Description: Tests grid cell size constant is 0.32f (32cm) as per requirement for 32cm x 32cm grid squares (REQ-1.1.1)

Test Name: MajorLineInterval
Test Description: Tests major line interval constant is 1.6f (160cm) for thicker grid lines every 5 cells (REQ-1.1.4)

Test Name: VisibilityControl
Test Description: Tests setVisible() and isVisible() methods for controlling grid visibility state

Test Name: DISABLED_GridMeshGeneration5m
Test Description: Tests grid mesh generation with 5m³ workspace calculating expected 17x17 grid lines with 3 major lines per direction (disabled due to initialization requirement)

Test Name: DISABLED_GridMeshGeneration2m
Test Description: Tests grid mesh generation with 2m³ workspace calculating expected 9x9 grid lines with 1 major line per direction (disabled due to initialization requirement)

Test Name: DISABLED_GridMeshGeneration8m
Test Description: Tests grid mesh generation with 8m³ workspace calculating expected 27x27 grid lines with 5 major lines per direction (disabled due to initialization requirement)

Test Name: DISABLED_GridLinePositions
Test Description: Tests grid line positions and spacing with 3.2m workspace verifying lines at multiples of 0.32m and major lines at -1.6m, 0m, +1.6m (disabled due to initialization requirement)

Test Name: DISABLED_RenderWithoutCrash
Test Description: Tests render() method doesn't crash with mock renderer, identity matrices, and cursor position set (disabled due to initialization requirement)

Test Name: DISABLED_OpacityParameters
Test Description: Tests setOpacityParameters() with custom values (0.2f, 0.8f) and default reset behavior (disabled due to initialization requirement)

Test Name: DISABLED_NoRenderWhenInvisible
Test Description: Tests that render() returns early without rendering when grid visibility is set to false (disabled due to initialization requirement)

Test Name: DISABLED_GridCenteredAtOrigin
Test Description: Tests grid is centered at origin (0,0,0) with symmetric 6.4m workspace extending from -3.2m to +3.2m (REQ-1.1.5) (disabled due to initialization requirement)

Test Name: ShaderCompilation
Test Description: Tests basic grid creation and visibility state changes without full OpenGL initialization

Test Name: DISABLED_UpdateWithSameSize
Test Description: Tests updateGridMesh() optimization when called with same workspace size (should be no-op) (disabled due to initialization requirement)
