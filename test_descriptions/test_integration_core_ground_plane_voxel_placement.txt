Test Name: TestClickOriginPlacesVoxelAtOrigin
Test Description: Tests that clicking on ground plane at world origin (0,0,0) correctly places a voxel at grid position (0,0,0).

Test Name: TestClickVariousGroundPositions
Test Description: Tests ground plane clicking at various positions with 1cm resolution to validate exact positioning without snapping.

Test Name: TestGroundPlaneExactPositioning
Test Description: Tests that voxels are placed at exact 1cm increment positions without any grid snapping occurring.

Test Name: TestGroundVsExistingVoxel
Test Description: Tests placement behavior when clicking near existing voxels vs empty ground plane areas.

Test Name: TestBuildGroundPattern
Test Description: Tests building a 3x3 square pattern on the ground plane to validate multiple sequential placements.

Test Name: TestUndoRedoGroundPlacement
Test Description: Tests undo/redo functionality works correctly with ground plane voxel placement operations.

Test Name: TestArbitrarySizeVoxelsAtAnyPosition
Test Description: Tests new requirement that voxels of any size can be placed at any 1cm position without resolution-based snapping.
