## Completed Integration Test Fixes

We are fixing integration tests. We made some changes to the placement
of voxels. Voxels are now placed on the ground plane vs the middle of
the voxels being at the ground plane. We also decreased the number of
grid resolutions.

## Mouse Click to Voxel Placement Issues - Fix Plan

Deep analysis has revealed critical issues in the mouse click to voxel placement pipeline.
Each fix includes validation tests to ensure correctness.

### Phase 1: Ray Generation Fixes

[Complete, Atlas] **Fix 1.1: Verify and fix matrix transpose in ray generation** - Matrix conversion corrected, all unit tests passing
  - Location: MouseInteraction.cpp:370-378
  - Issue: GLM/Math::Matrix4f conversion may have incorrect transpose
  - Fix: Ensure proper row/column major conversion
  - Validation Test: test_unit_cli_ray_generation_accuracy
    - Test ray generation at multiple screen positions
    - Verify ray origin matches camera position
    - Verify ray direction is normalized
    - Test corner cases (screen edges, center)

[Complete, Flux] **Fix 1.2: Add ray visualization for debugging**
  - Add debug rendering of rays in 3D space
  - Implementation:
    - Added ray visualization flag to MouseInteraction class
    - Integrated with FeedbackRenderer's OverlayRenderer to draw yellow rays
    - Added "debug ray" CLI command to toggle visualization on/off
    - Ray is rendered from camera position through mouse cursor position
  - Validation Test: test_integration_cli_ray_visualization (created, pending build fix)
    - Visual test comparing ray direction to expected path
    - Verify ray passes through clicked screen point
    - Test ray follows mouse movement
    - Test debug command toggles visualization
### Phase 2: Face Detection Algorithm Simplification

[In Progress, Atlas] - Created validation test, needs algorithm rewrite: **Fix 2.1: Simplify DDA traversal algorithm**
  - Location: FaceDetector.cpp:155-448
  - Issue: Over-complex traversal with many edge cases
  - Fix: Rewrite with clearer algorithm, better documentation
  - Validation Test: test_unit_core_face_detector_traversal (CREATED)
    - Test rays from multiple angles (FAILING - misses voxels)
    - Test rays starting inside/outside voxels (FAILING)
    - Verify correct face is detected for each case (FAILING)
  - Discovered Issues:
    - Current algorithm steps by 1cm regardless of voxel size (32cm), causing it to miss voxels
    - Complex face direction logic with multiple fallbacks
    - Excessive logging causing performance issues
    - Needs complete rewrite with proper voxel-size-aware traversal
  - Next Steps:
    - Rewrite initializeTraversal() to use voxel-size-aware stepping
    - Simplify stepTraversal() to step by voxel size, not 1cm
    - Remove excessive logging for performance
    - Use the new determineFaceDirection() method (already added)
    - Make algorithm handle all voxel sizes (1cm to 512cm) correctly
[In Progress, Echo] **Fix 2.2: Fix workspace boundary ray initialization** - Created test, confirmed issue exists

    - Verify all boundary voxels are detectable

[Complete, Zenith] **Fix 2.3: Improve face direction determination** - Simplified algorithm implemented
  - Location: FaceDetector.cpp:319-412
  - Issue: Complex logic for determining which face was hit
  - Fix: Use simpler, more robust algorithm
  - Validation Test: test_unit_face_direction_accuracy (CREATED)
    - Test rays hitting each face of a voxel
    - Verify correct face direction returned
    - Test edge cases (diagonal rays, grazing angles)
  - Implementation:
    - Created determineFaceDirection() method with simpler hit point distance check
    - Replaced 90+ lines of complex t-value calculations with 50 lines of clear logic
    - Algorithm now checks distance from hit point to each face plane
    - Falls back to ray direction for edge cases
    - Tests still failing due to underlying traversal issues (Fix 2.1)

### Implementation Priority
1. Start with Phase 3 (Coordinate System) - fundamental issue
2. Then Phase 2 (Face Detection) - core functionality
3. Then Phase 1 (Ray Generation) - input accuracy
4. Then Phase 4 (Placement Logic) - user experience
5. Then Phase 5 (Visual Feedback) - polish
6. Finally Phase 6 (Integration Testing) - validation

Each fix should be implemented with its validation test to ensure the issue is resolved and doesn't regress.
