# Hang Analysis for Workspace Boundary Test

## The Issue

The test hangs when calling `setVoxelAtWorldPos` with world coordinates (0.08, 0.08, 0.08) after successfully placing a voxel at grid position (0,0,0).

## Log Analysis

From the debug logs:
1. First voxel placed successfully at grid (0,0,0)
2. `setVoxelAtWorldPos` called with (0.08, 0.08, 0.08)
3. `isValidIncrementPosition` check passes
4. The hang occurs after this point

## Code Flow

The next steps in the code would be:
1. Get the grid for the resolution âœ“
2. Convert world position to grid position using `VoxelPosition::fromWorldSpace`
3. Call `wouldOverlapInternal` to check for overlaps
4. Call `grid->setVoxelAtWorldPos`

## Likely Cause

The hang is most likely in `wouldOverlapInternal`. Looking at the nested loops:

```cpp
for (int x = minGridCheck.x; x <= maxGridCheck.x; ++x) {
    for (int y = minGridCheck.y; y <= maxGridCheck.y; ++y) {
        for (int z = minGridCheck.z; z <= maxGridCheck.z; ++z) {
            if (grid->getVoxel(Math::Vector3i(x, y, z))) {
```

If `minGridCheck` and `maxGridCheck` have extremely large ranges (possibly due to integer overflow or incorrect calculations), this could create a very long-running or infinite loop.

## Potential Issues

1. **Coordinate System Mismatch**: The VoxelGrid expects coordinates from 0 to workspaceSize, but there might be negative coordinates being passed.

2. **Integer Overflow**: When calculating grid bounds in `wouldOverlapInternal`, if the division results in very large numbers, the loop could run for a very long time.

3. **Bounds Calculation Error**: The calculation of `minGridCheck` and `maxGridCheck` might be producing incorrect values.

## Next Steps

1. Add bounds checking to the loop indices
2. Add logging for the calculated bounds
3. Fix the coordinate system mismatch between centered and non-centered systems
