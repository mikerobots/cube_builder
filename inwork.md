# In-Work: Visual Verification Test Implementation

## Overview
Implementing automated visual verification testing for the voxel editor CLI application. The goal is to create a test that can run the CLI app, add voxels, take screenshots, and verify the rendering worked correctly.

## Summary of Work Completed
- Implemented screenshot functionality that captures the OpenGL framebuffer
- Created automated test scripts for visual verification
- Fixed critical bugs in octree voxel storage
- Debugged OpenGL rendering pipeline issues
- Created minimal test programs to isolate rendering problems

## Current Status
✅ Screenshot functionality implemented
✅ Visual verification test script created
✅ Commands work and voxels are placed correctly
✅ Mesh generation working (vertices and indices created correctly)
✅ Camera positioning configurable (default looking at workspace center)
✅ Octree voxel storage fixed (was returning wrong positions)
✅ Shader program compiles and links successfully
✅ OpenGL context working (can change clear color)
✅ Screenshot now reads from correct buffer after swap
✅ Switched to OpenGL 2.1 for better compatibility
✅ Immediate mode rendering works after disabling depth test and face culling
✅ Yellow rectangle successfully renders with glRectf
✅ Test triangle renders (proving shaders work)
❌ Voxels not rendering due to duplicate render code blocks
❌ VAO creation fails with GL_INVALID_OPERATION (1282) but fallback to VBOs should work
⚠️  GLAD library is just a stub - VAO functions loaded manually
⚠️  OpenGLRenderer class is mostly stubs
⚠️  Need to remove test rendering code that prevents voxel rendering

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Screenshot Functionality
**File: `apps/cli/src/RenderWindow.cpp`**
- Added `saveScreenshot(const std::string& filename)` method
- Captures OpenGL framebuffer using `glReadPixels()`
- Saves as PPM format (simple bitmap format, no external dependencies)
- Handles vertical flip (OpenGL renders upside-down)
- Adds `.ppm` extension if user specifies `.png`

### 2. New CLI Commands
**File: `apps/cli/src/Commands.cpp`**

#### Screenshot Command
```cpp
m_commandProcessor->registerCommand({
    "screenshot",
    "Take a screenshot of the current view",
    CommandCategory::VIEW,
    {"ss", "capture"},
    {{"filename", "Output filename (.png)", "string", true, ""}},
    [this](const CommandContext& ctx) {
        std::string filename = ctx.getArg(0);
        // ... 
        render(); // Render before screenshot
        if (m_renderWindow->saveScreenshot(filename)) {
            return CommandResult::Success("Screenshot saved: " + filename);
        }
        // ...
    }
});
```

#### Sleep Command
```cpp
m_commandProcessor->registerCommand({
    "sleep",
    "Pause execution for specified seconds",
    CommandCategory::SYSTEM,
    {"wait", "pause"},
    {{"seconds", "Number of seconds to sleep", "float", true, ""}},
    // ... implementation using std::this_thread::sleep_for
});
```

### 3. Mesh Update Fixes
**File: `apps/cli/src/Commands.cpp`**
Added `requestMeshUpdate()` calls after voxel operations:
- After `place` command
- After `delete` command
- After `fill` command
- After `undo` command
- After `redo` command

### 4. Camera Distance Fix
**File: `apps/cli/src/Commands.cpp`**
- Added distance reset after camera preset changes
- Ensures camera stays at reasonable distance for viewing voxels

### 5. VAO Function Loading
**File: `apps/cli/src/Application.cpp`**
- Manually load VAO functions since GLAD is a stub
- Load functions via `glfwGetProcAddress()`
- Functions loaded: `glGenVertexArrays`, `glBindVertexArray`, `glDeleteVertexArrays`

## Major Bug Fixes

### 1. Octree Voxel Position Bug
**File: `core/voxel_data/SparseOctree.h`**

The octree was returning incorrect voxel positions. All voxels were being reported at the same position.

**Problem**: 
- With octree depth 2 for a 4x4x4 grid, multiple voxels mapped to the same leaf node
- The `collectVoxels` function was returning the node center instead of actual voxel positions
- When inserting (0,0,0) and (1,0,0), both went to leaf center (1,1,1)

**Solution**:
1. Fixed octree depth calculation to ensure sufficient depth
2. Modified `OctreeNode` to store the actual voxel position
3. Updated `collectVoxels` to return stored positions instead of calculating from centers

```cpp
// Added to OctreeNode
Math::Vector3i m_voxelPos;  // Store actual voxel position
void setVoxel(bool value, const Math::Vector3i& pos) {
    m_hasVoxel = value;
    m_voxelPos = pos;
}
```

### 2. GLAD VAO Support
**Problem**: GLAD is just a stub file without proper VAO function pointers

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. ✅ Manually load VAO functions using `glfwGetProcAddress`
2. ✅ Define function pointer types
3. ❌ Functions load but rendering still doesn't work

## Debug Findings

### 1. Voxel Mesh Generation
- ✅ Working correctly: generates proper vertices and indices
- Example for 128cm voxel at (0,0,0):
  - 24 vertices (4 per face × 6 faces)
  - 36 indices (2 triangles per face × 3 indices per triangle)
  - World position: (0.64, 0.64, 0.64)
  - Vertex range: 0.032 to 1.248

### 2. Camera Configuration
- Initial position: (7.11, 7.11, 7.11) looking at (2.5, 2.5, 2.5)
- Distance: 5.0 units (was 8.0, then 2.0, settled on 5.0)
- View preset: Isometric
- Projection: Perspective with 60° FOV

### 3. Shader Program
- ✅ Compiles successfully
- ✅ Links successfully
- ✅ All critical uniforms found (model, view, projection)
- Warnings about unused varyings are normal when using simplified shaders

### 4. Rendering Pipeline Issue
**Symptoms**:
- OpenGL context works (can change clear color)
- Shader program active and uniforms set correctly
- VAO created (ID: 1)
- No OpenGL errors reported
- But no triangles rendered (even simple test triangles)

**Root Cause**: VAO binding/state issue preventing any geometry from being drawn

## Test Scripts Created

1. **`test_single_voxel.sh`** - Tests rendering a single voxel
2. **`test_voxel_nocamera.sh`** - Tests without camera movement
3. **`test_octree_debug.sh`** - Debug octree position mapping
4. **`test_voxel_simple.sh`** - Original simple L-shape test

## Current Status After Fixes

The immediate mode rendering issue has been resolved:
- Disabling depth test and face culling in window creation allows rendering
- Yellow rectangle successfully renders with glRectf()
- Test triangle can render with shaders

However, voxels are still not visible despite:
- Reaching the voxel rendering code path
- Using manual vertex setup (VBO) instead of VAO
- Having correct vertex data and indices
- Shader program compiling and linking successfully

The likely issue is with the shader transformations or vertex attributes. The NDC coordinates show the voxels might be rendered at the edge of the view frustum.

## Current Blockers

### Voxels Not Visible
Despite switching to OpenGL 2.1 and trying various approaches:
- glClear() works (can change background color)
- glBegin()/glEnd() immediate mode doesn't draw
- glRectf() doesn't draw  
- VAO/VBO with shaders doesn't draw
- Screenshot correctly captures cleared color but no geometry

**Debug Actions Taken**:
1. ✅ Fixed screenshot to read from back buffer (was reading from front after swap)
2. ✅ Switched from Core Profile 3.3 to OpenGL 2.1
3. ✅ Reset all OpenGL state (depth test, culling, blending, etc.)
4. ✅ Used orthographic projection with glOrtho()
5. ✅ Verified viewport is correct (0, 0, 1280, 720)
6. ✅ Verified draw buffer is GL_BACK
7. ✅ Tried multiple primitive types (triangles, quads, glRectf)
8. ✅ Created minimal test program - IT WORKS! Renders correctly
9. ✅ Bypassed OpenGLRenderer to use raw OpenGL calls
10. ✅ Verified context is current with glfwGetCurrentContext()
11. ✅ Removed duplicate clear that was overwriting red with blue

**Key Finding**: 
- Minimal test program with same GLFW setup renders correctly
- Main app clears correctly but draw commands produce no output
- The issue is specific to our application's render() function

**Current Status**:
- Red background now visible (clear works)
- Yellow rect still not rendering (draw commands fail)
- Issue is isolated to the main application (minimal test works perfectly)

**Root Cause**: Unknown OpenGL state conflict in the main application preventing primitive rendering

**Impact**: Visual verification tests cannot verify rendered output, but all other functionality works:
- Screenshot capture works correctly
- Voxel data structures work correctly  
- Mesh generation works correctly
- Camera system works correctly

The only issue is that OpenGL draw calls (glBegin/glEnd, glRectf, glDrawElements) produce no visible output in the main application context.

## Command Reference

### Build
```bash
cmake --build build --target VoxelEditor_CLI
```

### Test Voxel Rendering
```bash
# Simple test
./build/bin/VoxelEditor_CLI << 'EOF'
resolution 128cm
place 0 0 0
screenshot test.png
quit
EOF

# Check if anything rendered (Python)
python3 -c "
data = open('test.ppm', 'rb').read()
header_end = data.find(b'255\\n') + 4
pixel = data[header_end:header_end+3]
print(f'First pixel: RGB{tuple(pixel)}')"
```

### Debug OpenGL
```bash
# Run with debug output
./build/bin/VoxelEditor_CLI 2>&1 | grep -E "(OpenGL error|shader program|VAO)"
```

## Next Steps

1. **Debug OpenGL State Issue**
   - Use OpenGL debugging tools (apitrace, RenderDoc)
   - Add comprehensive state tracking
   - Compare state between working minimal test and main app
   - Check for state changes from other subsystems

2. **Alternative Solutions**
   - Generate proper GLAD loader with full OpenGL support
   - Switch to GLEW for OpenGL function loading
   - Consider using a different rendering backend (Vulkan, Metal)

3. **Workarounds**
   - Export voxel data to standard 3D format (OBJ/STL) for verification
   - Implement software rasterizer for testing
   - Use external viewer to verify mesh generation
