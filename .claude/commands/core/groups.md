You are in charge of making the core/groups subsystem work. From the
root folder, this is in ./core/groups. You can run the unit tests via
the run_tests.sh shell script. Please run test tests and fix until
they work. Update the ./core/groups/TODO.md with your status and
progress. Remove any outdated information from that TODO.md file.
