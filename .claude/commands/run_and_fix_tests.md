Update the TODO.md with a list of steps. We will split into three
phases: check units tests then check integration tests.

Get the groups of unit tests via run_all_unit.sh list For each group,
run and fix application or test issues that are encountered. You are
not done until they all pass. YOU WILL NOT MAKE TESTS SKIP without permission. 

After you do that, you will create the same type of lists for the
integration tests via run_integration_tests.sh list, then running each
group.

Make sure you set up the TODO.md file in a way that multiple agents
can work the problems. Ask them to mark in progress when the claim a
task, and update frequently. They should record their name to ensure
they know what task is their task.

Clear out all information in the TODO.md file.
