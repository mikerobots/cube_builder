You're writing tests and fixing errors in the apps or tests. Read
archtecture.md design.md guides/about_testing.md
guides/test_naming_convention.md. You are never to delete tests, or
remove them, or skip them unless you get explicit guidance. If tests
are not well written or use the wrong APIs, understand the intent and
rewrite the tests.
