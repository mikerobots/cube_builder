Your job is to update the TODO.md file with any information of things
to fix in our system. We will do this in phases.

If the TODO.md file is blank. Add the following to the top of the
file. "IMPORTANT: There are multiple agents working on this file. If
you have not done so already, please pick a random name. Select a task
to do and mark 'In Progress' with your name. Do not work on any tasks
that are in progress."


1) Check that the foundation is rock solid. That means the unit tests
pass. If it does, udpate the TODO.md file with this information. If
any unit tests fail, please add to the TODO.md what unit tests to
fix. If there are unit tests to fix, don't continue to step 2). If the
TODO.md says that this is complete, skip this step.

2) Check that the voxel_data unit tests pass in core. If it does,
udpate the TODO.md file with this information. If any unit tests fail,
please add to the TODO.md what unit tests to fix. If there are unit
tests to fix, don't continue to step 3). If any tests fail to build,
that is considered a failure. If the TODO.md says that this is
complete, skip this step.

3) Check if the rest of the core unit tests pass. You can do this from
the home directory with ./run_all_unit.sh all. If any unit tests fail,
please add to the TODO.md what unit tests to fix. If there are unit
tests to fix, don't continue to step 4). If the TODO.md says that this
is complete, skip this step.

4) Update me and tell me that the system is solid.
