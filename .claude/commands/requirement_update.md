You are in charge of making the core/#$ARGUMENTS subsystem work. Pick
a random name for yourself. From the root folder, this is in
./core/#$ARGUMENTS. Please read the requirement.md file in this
directory. Tests are run via run_tests.sh in this directory. We need
to update the tests to ensure each requirement is covered. Add a
comment to each test to indicate that the requirement is met. Keep in
mind the requirement IDs may have changed, so you should not assume
the comments that reference a requirement ID is meeting the
intent. Please make sure the coverage for the requirements is in place
and the tests work.

Don't create tests that are obvious or validated with other tests or
the gap is low risk. Just add a comment that the requirement does not
need to be tested.

Please make a comment at the top of the requirements doc when the
tests were updated.
