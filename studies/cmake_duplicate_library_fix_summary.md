# CMake Duplicate Library Linking Fix Summary

## Issue
The build system was producing numerous warnings about duplicate library linking, particularly for VoxelEditor libraries like FileIO, Groups, Rendering, Selection, and VoxelData.

## Root Cause
Test CMakeLists.txt files were explicitly linking to libraries that were already transitively provided by other libraries they linked to, violating the principle that if library A publicly links to library B, then anything linking to A doesn't need to explicitly link to B.

## Key Findings

### 1. Circular Dependency
- **VoxelEditor_Selection** was linking to **VoxelEditor_FileIO**
- **VoxelEditor_FileIO** was linking to **VoxelEditor_Selection**
- This created a circular dependency that was resolved by removing FileIO from Selection's dependencies

### 2. Transitive Dependencies Map
- **VoxelEditor_VoxelData** → Math, Events, Memory
- **VoxelEditor_Rendering** → Math, Events, Camera, VoxelData, Logging
- **VoxelEditor_Groups** → Math, Rendering, VoxelData, Events, Memory, Logging
- **VoxelEditor_Selection** → VoxelData, Rendering
- **VoxelEditor_FileIO** → Math, Rendering, VoxelData, Groups, Selection, Camera, Events, Memory, Logging

## Changes Made

### Core Library Changes
1. **core/selection/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed `VoxelEditor_FileIO` from target_link_libraries to fix circular dependency

### Test CMakeLists.txt Changes
Fixed redundant library linking in the following test files:

1. **core/camera/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed: Math, Events (provided by Camera)

2. **core/groups/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed: VoxelData, Rendering, Math, Events, Memory, Logging (provided by Groups)

3. **core/input/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed: Math, Events (provided by Input)

4. **core/rendering/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed: Math, Events, Camera, VoxelData (provided by Rendering)

5. **core/surface_gen/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed: Math (provided by SurfaceGen)

6. **core/undo_redo/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed: Math (provided by UndoRedo)

7. **core/visual_feedback/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed: VoxelData, Camera, Rendering, Math, Events (provided by VisualFeedback and Selection)

8. **core/voxel_data/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed: Math, Events, Memory (provided by VoxelData)

9. **foundation/config/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
   - Removed: Events, Math (provided by Config → Events → Math)

10. **foundation/events/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
    - Removed: Math (provided by Events)

11. **foundation/memory/tests/CMakeLists.txt**
    - Removed: Events, Math (provided by Memory)

12. **tests/integration/CMakeLists.txt**
    - Multiple tests updated to remove transitively linked libraries

13. **tests/integration/rendering/CMakeLists.txt**
    - Removed Math from all rendering integration tests (provided by Rendering)

14. **tests/performance/CMakeLists.txt**
    - Removed: Math, Events (provided by VoxelData and UndoRedo)

15. **tests/verification/CMakeLists.txt**
    - Simplified to use FileIO as the top-level dependency that brings in most other libraries

## Results
- All duplicate VoxelEditor library warnings have been eliminated
- Build system now properly leverages transitive dependencies
- Cleaner and more maintainable CMakeLists.txt files
- Only remaining warnings are about duplicate gtest libraries (separate issue)

## Best Practices Going Forward
1. When adding library dependencies, check what the library already links to publicly
2. Only explicitly link to libraries that are directly used by the code
3. Avoid circular dependencies between libraries
4. Use CMake's transitive dependency feature to reduce redundancy
