# TODO - Core Subsystem Review and Cleanup

## Process for Each Subsystem

For each subsystem in the core folder:

1. **Review Changes**: Look at git diffs to identify any hacks or temporary fixes
2. **Document Issues**: Record identified hacks in the subsystem's TODO.md file
3. **Update Documentation**: Update the subsystem's DESIGN.md to reflect current implementation
4. **Run Tests**: Execute the subsystem's test suite
5. **Fix Issues**: Address all test failures and documented hacks
6. **Commit Changes**: Create a clean commit for the subsystem
7. **Update Progress**: Mark subsystem as complete in this file
