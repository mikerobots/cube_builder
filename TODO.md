## Face Detection Issue with Single Voxel

We are fixing the following problem. If one voxel is placed (let's call it voxel1), the face detection clicking is only partially working. Meaning I can hover over part of the faces and the preview or clicking will work fine. When I hover over other parts of the face, it shows a preview at 0,0 (jumping from the cursor). Once I add a second voxel (let's call it voxel2), the face clicking/hovering for voxel1 works great.
