# Voxel Editor - Development Status

## Current Work: CLI Application Rendering System Refactoring

### What We Did
Refactored the CLI application to use the core rendering subsystem instead of making direct OpenGL calls. This aligns with the modular architecture where all OpenGL operations should be handled by the core rendering system.

### Changes Made
1. **RenderWindow** 
   - Removed direct OpenGL initialization code
   - Now delegates viewport management to RenderEngine
   - Screenshot functionality now uses RenderEngine::captureFrame()

2. **Application**
   - Removed all OpenGL headers and direct GL calls
   - Properly initializes RenderEngine in the rendering pipeline
   - Cleaned up VAO function pointer loading that was in initializeCLI()

3. **Commands**
   - Updated debug commands to use RenderEngine statistics instead of direct OpenGL queries
   - Replaced immediate mode triangle test with proper mesh rendering through RenderEngine

4. **RenderEngine**
   - Implemented captureFrame() method for screenshot functionality
   - Updated shaders from GLSL 120 to 330 core for OpenGL 3.3 core profile compatibility

### Current State
The refactoring is complete and VAO support has been successfully implemented for macOS:

- **Fixed**: VAO initialization now works correctly on macOS using dynamic function loading
- **Implemented**: MacOSGLLoader that properly loads OpenGL VAO functions at runtime
- **Working**: Default VAO is created and bound during OpenGL context initialization
- **Verified**: The application now runs without GL_INVALID_OPERATION errors for vertex attributes

### VAO Implementation Details
1. **MacOSGLLoader**: Created a macOS-specific OpenGL function loader that:
   - Dynamically loads VAO functions from the OpenGL framework
   - Supports both standard (glGenVertexArrays) and Apple-specific (glGenVertexArraysAPPLE) functions
   - Properly initializes function pointers at runtime

2. **OpenGLRenderer Updates**:
   - VAO creation now properly creates and manages vertex array objects
   - Each mesh gets its own VAO with vertex attributes configured
   - Default VAO is created during context initialization as required by OpenGL 3.3 Core

3. **RenderEngine Integration**:
   - Mesh setup now creates VAO and configures vertex attributes within VAO context
   - VAO is properly bound before rendering operations

### Next Steps
1. ~~Fix VAO initialization on macOS for proper OpenGL 3.3 core profile support~~ ✅ COMPLETED
2. ~~Verify core rendering functionality with standalone test~~ ✅ COMPLETED
   - Created test_render_core.cpp that successfully renders a colored triangle
   - Fixed shader lighting issue by simplifying fragment shader  
   - Confirmed VAO support works correctly on macOS
   - Triangle renders with correct vertex colors (red, green, blue)

### Core Rendering Validation Results
The standalone test program (`test_render_core.cpp`) successfully validates that:
- VAO initialization works correctly with dynamic function loading on macOS
- Vertex and index buffers are created and managed properly
- Shaders compile and link successfully
- Uniforms (model, view, projection matrices) are set correctly
- Triangle renders with proper vertex color interpolation
- Screenshot capture functionality works

The test renders a simple triangle with red, green, and blue vertices, and the output shows proper color interpolation across the triangle surface.

### Current Issue: Voxel Rendering Without Lighting
**Status**: Basic rendering works, but voxels appear as solid yellow with no lighting effects.

#### Problem
- Voxels are rendering but appear as flat, solid yellow color
- No visible lighting or shading effects
- Likely issues:
  - Lighting calculations not working in shaders
  - Normals not being passed correctly to shaders
  - Lighting uniforms not being set properly
  - Shader may be using a fallback color instead of calculated lighting

#### Tasks to Fix Lighting
1. **Investigate shader lighting calculations**
   - Check vertex and fragment shaders for lighting implementation
   - Verify lighting equations are correct
   - Ensure shader is using lighting calculations, not just outputting solid color

2. **Verify normal data flow**
   - Check if normals are generated correctly in VoxelMeshGenerator
   - Verify normals are included in vertex data sent to GPU
   - Ensure vertex attributes for normals are properly configured

3. **Check lighting uniforms**
   - Verify light position/direction uniforms are being set
   - Check if material properties are being passed to shaders
   - Ensure view position is available for specular calculations

4. **Test with simplified shader**
   - Create a debug shader that visualizes normals as colors
   - Verify basic lighting with a simple directional light
   - Gradually add complexity back

### Other Remaining Tasks
1. Fix shader attribute naming inconsistencies (shader expects different attribute names)
2. Resolve VisualFeedback module compilation errors with Vector3i streaming operators
3. Update GLAD to properly load OpenGL functions instead of being a stub
4. Add proper error handling for OpenGL context creation failures
5. Complete the rendering test coverage plan below

# Previous Plan: Rendering Test Coverage

## Current Status
The rendering pipeline has been debugged and is working, but test coverage analysis reveals critical gaps that need to be addressed to ensure rendering functions work correctly.

## Priority 1: Critical Missing Test Coverage

  - Test polygon mode (fill vs wireframe)
  - Test line width and point size settings
  
- [ ] **Binding state tests**:
  - Test shader binding and switching
  - Test texture binding to multiple slots

  - Test reset() returns to known default state
  - Test initial state after construction

protected:
    void SetUp() override {
        // Initialize OpenGL context if needed
        // Create RenderState instance
    }
    
    void TearDown() override {
        // Cleanup
    }
    
    // Helper to verify GL state matches RenderState
    void VerifyGLState(const RenderState& state);
};
```

### Mock Requirements
- Mock OpenGL functions for unit tests
- Mock RenderContext for isolated testing
- Mock Mesh data for render tests

## Success Criteria

1. **All tests pass**: No failing tests in the rendering module
2. **Visual validation**: Screenshots show correct rendering
3. **Functionality**: All render functions work as expected
4. **Stability**: No crashes or GL errors during extended use

## Execution Order

1. Start with RenderState tests (most critical gap)
2. Add renderMesh() test coverage
3. Implement shader loading from files
4. Implement visual validation framework

This plan ensures the rendering functions are properly tested and work correctly.
