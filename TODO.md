## Integration Test Status Report

### Test Run Summary
- **Total Integration Tests**: 61
- **Passed**: 58 ✓
- **Failed**: 0 ✗
- **Skipped**: 3 (test_integration_cli_ray_visualization, test_integration_shader_uniform_validation, test_integration_visual_reference_image_comparison)

### Fixed Integration Tests

#### 1. test_integration_overlay_rendering_positions - FIXED by Nova ✓
**Issue**: Fragment shader was hardcoded to output yellow color for debugging
**Solution**: Removed debug code and restored proper color passthrough (`color = fragColor;`)
**File**: core/visual_feedback/src/OverlayRenderer.cpp:681
**Result**: All 3 test cases now pass:
- `GroundPlaneGridTopView` ✓
- `OutlineBoxPositions` ✓
- `FunctionalRenderingTest` ✓

### Integration Test Summary
All integration tests that are not skipped are now passing. The 3 skipped tests appear to be placeholders or require specific features not yet implemented.
