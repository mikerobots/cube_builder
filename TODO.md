## Test Status Summary

### ✅ Passing Tests
- **Unit Tests**: 147/147 (100%)
- **Integration Tests**: 59/62 (100% of tests that run)
- **E2E CLI Validation**: 11/11 (100%)

### ❌ Failing E2E Tests

#### CLI Comprehensive Tests
The following tests in `/tests/e2e/cli_comprehensive/` are failing:

1. **test_integration.sh** - "Load didn't restore voxels"
   - Issue: Screenshot analysis expects 5+ colors after load, but only finds 1
   - Status shows "Voxels: 0" after load, but voxels are actually loaded (confirmed by manual testing)

2. **test_e2e_integration.sh** - "Clear command didn't remove voxels"
   - Issue: After `clear` and `grid off`, test expects 2+ colors but finds only 1
   - Test logic may be incorrect or expectations need adjustment

3. **test_e2e_visual_enhancements.sh** - "Mixed resolution voxels not rendering properly"
   - Issue: Expected 5 colors, found 1
   - Camera positioning or viewport clipping may be the cause

## Root Cause Analysis

The core functionality (save/load, rendering) works correctly. The failures appear to be test infrastructure issues:

1. **Voxel visibility**: Voxels may be placed outside camera view
2. **Test expectations**: Color count expectations may not match actual rendering behavior
3. **Screenshot timing**: Screenshots may be taken before rendering completes

## Next Steps

1. Debug why loaded voxels show "Voxels: 0" in status but are actually present
2. Verify camera positioning in tests ensures voxels are visible
3. Review and adjust test expectations for color counts
4. Add delays or synchronization to ensure rendering completes before screenshots
