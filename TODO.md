# TODO - Core Subsystem Review and Cleanup

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: MULTIPLE AGENTS WORKING CONCURRENTLY ⚠️

**This TODO list is being worked on by MULTIPLE AGENTS simultaneously.**

### Before Starting Work:
1. **CHECK STATUS FIRST**: Only work on subsystems marked as `[ ]` (not started)
2. **SKIP IN-PROGRESS ITEMS**: If a subsystem is marked as `[IN PROGRESS]`, DO NOT work on it
3. **MARK YOUR WORK**: Immediately mark a subsystem as `[IN PROGRESS]` when you start
4. **ONE AT A TIME**: Only work on ONE subsystem at a time

### Process for Each Subsystem

For each subsystem in the core folder:

1. **Review Changes**: Look at git diffs to identify any hacks or temporary fixes
2. **Document Issues**: Record identified hacks in the subsystem's TODO.md file
3. **Update Documentation**: Update the subsystem's DESIGN.md to reflect current implementation
4. **Run Tests**: Execute the subsystem's test suite
5. **Fix Issues**: Address all test failures and documented hacks
6. **Commit Changes**: Create a clean commit for the subsystem
7. **Update Progress**: Mark subsystem as complete in this file
