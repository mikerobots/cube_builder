# TODO List

## Progress Summary
- **Completed**: 10/10 design reviews (100%)
- **In Progress**: 0/10 design reviews (0%)
- **Remaining**: 0/10 design reviews (0%)

### Working Order
- All subsystems have been reviewed and updated
- Each review added "Current Implementation Status" and "Known Issues and Technical Debt" sections

## Core Subsystem Design Review

- [x] Review and update core/groups/DESIGN.md (COMPLETED - Added implementation status, 8 architectural issues documented)
- [x] Review and update core/input/DESIGN.md (COMPLETED - Added implementation status, 8 architectural issues documented)
- [x] Review and update core/rendering/DESIGN.md (COMPLETED - Added implementation status, 10 architectural issues documented)
- [x] Review and update core/selection/DESIGN.md (COMPLETED - Added implementation status, 8 architectural issues documented)
- [x] Review and update core/surface_gen/DESIGN.md (COMPLETED - Added implementation status, 10 architectural issues documented)
- [x] Review and update core/undo_redo/DESIGN.md (COMPLETED - Comprehensive review already existed with 10 architectural issues)
- [x] Review and update core/visual_feedback/DESIGN.md (COMPLETED - Comprehensive review already existed with extensive technical debt documented)
- [x] Review and update core/voxel_data/DESIGN.md (COMPLETED - Added implementation status, architecture issues, migration path, and revised performance targets)

### Review Checklist for Each DESIGN.md

For each subsystem design file, ensure:
1. Purpose and scope are clearly defined
2. Key components and classes are documented
3. Dependencies on other subsystems are listed
4. Interfaces are well-defined
5. Implementation details are current
6. Performance considerations are noted
7. Testing strategy is included
8. Any TODOs or future enhancements are tracked

### Architecture and Design Issues to Identify

During each review, actively look for and document:
1. **Circular Dependencies**: Identify any circular dependencies between subsystems that need to be broken
2. **Tight Coupling**: Find areas where subsystems are too tightly coupled and need better abstraction
3. **Missing Abstractions**: Identify where interfaces or abstract base classes would improve modularity
4. **Performance Bottlenecks**: Document any design decisions that could impact performance at scale
5. **Memory Management Issues**: Identify potential memory leaks or inefficient memory usage patterns
6. **Thread Safety Concerns**: Note any shared state that isn't properly protected for multi-threading
7. **API Inconsistencies**: Find inconsistent naming, parameter ordering, or design patterns across subsystems
8. **Missing Error Handling**: Identify areas where error conditions aren't properly handled or propagated
9. **Scalability Limitations**: Document design choices that might limit future scalability
10. **Testing Difficulties**: Note designs that make unit testing difficult or impossible

### Issue Documentation Format

When issues are found, document them in the DESIGN.md file under a new section:

```markdown
## Known Issues and Technical Debt

### Issue 1: [Brief Description]
- **Severity**: High/Medium/Low
- **Impact**: Description of the impact
- **Proposed Solution**: How to fix it
- **Dependencies**: What other changes are needed

### Issue 2: [Brief Description]

## Summary of Major Findings Across All Subsystems

### Common Architectural Issues Found:
1. **Thread Safety**: Most subsystems lack proper thread safety mechanisms (8/9 subsystems)
2. **Missing Abstractions**: Direct coupling instead of interfaces (7/9 subsystems)
3. **Platform-Specific Code**: Not properly abstracted (5/9 subsystems)
4. **Memory Management**: Missing optimization strategies (6/9 subsystems)
5. **Circular Dependencies**: Potential issues in rendering, selection, and visual_feedback
6. **Missing Components**: Several designed components not implemented (7/9 subsystems)

### High-Priority Issues Requiring Immediate Attention:
1. **Rendering**: Missing VR support and FrameBuffer implementation
2. **Surface Generation**: No watertight mesh validation for 3D printing
3. **Undo/Redo**: Severe architectural issues with circular dependencies
4. **File I/O**: Thread safety concerns for auto-save functionality
5. **Input**: Thread safety and missing accessibility features

### Subsystems Needing Major Refactoring:
1. **Undo/Redo**: Complete architectural overhaul needed
2. **Visual Feedback**: Remove circular dependencies and add abstractions
3. **Rendering**: Platform abstraction and VR support

### Next Steps:
1. Complete voxel_data review
2. Create prioritized refactoring plan based on severity
3. Address high-priority thread safety issues across all subsystems
4. Implement missing abstractions to reduce coupling
