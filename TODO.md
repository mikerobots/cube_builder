## System Health Check Progress

### Phase 1: Foundation Layer Unit Tests
- Status: COMPLETE ✓ (All 13 tests pass)

### Phase 2: Core voxel_data Unit Tests
- Status: COMPLETE ✓ (All 199 tests pass)

#### Failed Tests to Fix:
1. CollisionSimple.ExactPositionMaintenance - FIXED by Nebula ✓
   - Issue: Test data had overlapping voxels (8cm voxel at (13,0,17) overlapped with 16cm voxel at (23,0,29))
   - Solution: Moved 16cm voxel from x=23 to x=25 to avoid overlap
   - File: core/voxel_data/tests/test_unit_core_voxel_data_collision_simple.cpp:106

2. VoxelOverlapTest.SmallVoxelOnLargeVoxelShouldBeAllowed - FIXED by Phoenix ✓
   - Issue: Collision detection prevented smaller voxels from being placed on/inside larger voxels
   - Solution: Modified wouldOverlapInternal() to allow smaller voxels on larger ones per REQ-5.2.5 and REQ-4.3.4
   - File: core/voxel_data/tests/test_unit_core_voxel_data_overlap_behavior.cpp

3. VoxelOverlapTest.SmallVoxelInsideLargeVoxel - FIXED by Phoenix ✓
   - Issue: Same as above - collision detection was too restrictive
   - Solution: Same fix allows small voxels inside large voxels for detailed work
   - File: core/voxel_data/tests/test_unit_core_voxel_data_overlap_behavior.cpp

4. VoxelDataRequirementsTest.AdjacentPositionCalculation - FIXED by Nebula ✓
   - Issue: Floating-point precision caused adjacent voxels to be detected as overlapping
   - Solution: Added epsilon tolerance (0.0001f) to overlap detection for adjacent voxels
   - File: core/voxel_data/VoxelDataManager.h in wouldOverlapInternal()

### Phase 2 Summary: ALL TESTS NOW PASS ✓ (199/199)
- Note: Had to fix one additional test in voxel_data after Phase 2 was marked complete

### Phase 3: All Core Unit Tests
- Status: COMPLETE ✓ (All 110 tests pass)

#### Failed Tests to Fix:
1. test_unit_core_voxel_data_manager - CollisionDetection_64cmAnd32cmOverlap - FIXED by Nebula ✓
   - Issue: Test expected smaller voxels couldn't be placed on larger ones
   - Solution: Updated test to match REQ-5.2.5 & REQ-4.3.4 requirements
   - File: core/voxel_data/tests/test_unit_core_voxel_data_manager.cpp
   
2. test_unit_core_input_placement_validation - ValidatePlacementBasic - FIXED by Orion ✓
   - Issue: Test expected 64cm and 256cm voxels would be invalid when they actually fit within bounds
   - Solution: Fixed test expectations to match actual behavior (voxelFitsInBounds checks full voxel extent)
   - File: core/input/tests/test_unit_core_input_placement_validation.cpp

### Phase 3 Summary: ALL TESTS NOW PASS ✓ (110/110)

### Phase 4: System Health Summary
- Status: COMPLETE ✓
