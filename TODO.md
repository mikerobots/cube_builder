## CRITICAL: Test System Integrity Check Required

**WARNING**: There are serious concerns about the test system integrity. We need to verify that:
1. Tests are actually being rebuilt when we make changes
2. Test assertions are properly failing when they should
3. The build system is not cached/stale

### Discovered Issues with test_unit_core_visual_feedback_face_detector

**Current Status**: All 25 tests report as PASSING, but there's a hidden failure!

**The Problem**:
- The `RayFromInside` test has debug output showing it expects `PositiveX` but gets `NegativeX`
- However, the test still passes because the assertion is inside an if-block:
  ```cpp
  if (face.isValid()) {
      EXPECT_EQ(face.getDirection(), VoxelEditor::VisualFeedback::FaceDirection::PositiveX);
  }
  ```
- This means the assertion fails but doesn't fail the overall test
- This is a TEST DESIGN BUG that hides real failures

**Evidence**:
```
RayFromInside test:
Voxel at increment (32,32,32) = world (0.32,0.32,0.32)
Voxel size: 0.32m
Ray origin: (0.32, 0.48, 0.32)
Ray origin in increment: (32, 48, 32)
Detected face direction: 1
Expected: PositiveX (0)
Actual: NegativeX
[       OK ] FaceDetectorTest.RayFromInside (0 ms)  <-- Test passes despite assertion failure!
```

### Required Actions

1. **Verify Build System**:
   - Clean rebuild: `rm -rf build_ninja && cmake -B build_ninja -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug && cmake --build build_ninja`
   - Verify timestamps on binaries match source file changes
   - Check if ccache or other caching is interfering

2. **Fix Test Design Issues**:
   - Move assertions outside of conditional blocks
   - Add explicit FAIL() calls when expected conditions aren't met
   - Review all tests for similar hidden failures

3. **Investigate Face Detection Bug**:
   - Ray starting inside voxel going +X should detect PositiveX exit face
   - Currently detects NegativeX (opposite direction)
   - This is a real bug being hidden by poor test design

### DO NOT PROCEED with other fixes until we verify test system integrity!
