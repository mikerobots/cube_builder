# Camera Configuration Test Summary

## Test Overview

The `default_camera_test.py` validates that the camera can properly view all voxels in a 5x5x5 grid. The test performs comprehensive validation across multiple aspects:

### 1. Field of View Validation
- **Purpose**: Ensures the 45° FOV can encompass the entire workspace
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Visible size at target distance: 1.039m
  - Required coverage for 5x5x5 grid at 8cm voxels: 0.400m
  - Coverage ratio: 2.60x (excellent margin)
- **Result**: ✓ FOV provides adequate coverage with margin

### 2. Camera Angle Validation
- **Purpose**: Verifies yaw/pitch angles provide good 3D perspective
- **Validated Angles**:
  - Yaw: 45° (rotation around Y-axis) - Good for 3D perspective
  - Pitch: 30° (elevation from horizontal) - Good elevation angle
  - Note: True isometric pitch is 35.264° (atan(1/√2))
- **Result**: ✓ Angles are within optimal range (30-60° yaw, 20-45° pitch)

### 3. Camera Position Calculation
- **Purpose**: Verifies camera is positioned correctly based on spherical coordinates
- **Current Configuration**:
  - Target: [0.200, 0.200, 0.200] meters (center of 5x5x5 grid)
  - Distance: 1.3 meters
  - Calculated position: [0.996, 0.850, 0.996] meters
  - Look direction: [-0.612, -0.500, -0.612] (normalized)
- **Result**: ✓ Camera correctly positioned and oriented

### 4. View/Projection Matrix Validation
- **Purpose**: Ensures matrices correctly transform coordinates
- **Key Checks**:
  - Target transforms to [0, 0, -distance] in view space
  - Frustum planes correctly sized
  - Near plane: 0.1m, Far plane: 100.0m
- **Result**: ✓ Matrices correctly configured

### 5. Edge Voxel Visibility Test
- **Purpose**: Verifies all corner and edge voxels are visible
- **Test Points**: 13 strategic voxels including:
  - 8 corners of the 5x5x5 grid
  - 4 edge centers
  - 1 grid center
- **NDC Bounds**: X[-0.252, 0.252] Y[-0.513, 0.429] Z[0.807, 0.875]
- **Result**: ✓ All 13/13 edge voxels visible

### 6. Screen Coverage Analysis
- **Purpose**: Ensures efficient use of screen space
- **Current Coverage**:
  - Horizontal: 25.2% of screen width
  - Vertical: 47.1% of screen height
- **Result**: Good balance - workspace is clearly visible without being too small or clipping

## Configuration Values

### Current (Valid) Configuration:
```cpp
// Center of 5x5x5 grid at 8cm voxels
m_cameraController->getCamera()->setTarget(Math::Vector3f(0.20f, 0.20f, 0.20f));
m_cameraController->getCamera()->setDistance(1.3f);
```

### Key Parameters:
- **Workspace**: 5x5x5 voxels
- **Voxel Size**: 8cm (0.08m)
- **Total Size**: 0.4m × 0.4m × 0.4m
- **Camera FOV**: 45°
- **Aspect Ratio**: 1280:720 (16:9)
- **View Preset**: ISOMETRIC (45° yaw, 30° pitch)

## Test Results

All three tested configurations pass:
1. ✅ Current defaults (1.3m distance)
2. ✅ Calculated optimal (1.25m distance)
3. ✅ True isometric view (35.264° pitch)

The current configuration provides excellent visibility of all voxels with comfortable margins.
