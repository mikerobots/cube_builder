Common Issues with OpenGL VAOs on macOS

On macOS, using OpenGL Vertex Array Objects (VAOs) can run into several common issues due to Apple’s deprecated OpenGL support, core profile constraints, and driver quirks. Here's a summary of the most frequent problems:

Compatibility vs Core Profile
Problem: macOS only supports the core profile of OpenGL 3.2+.

Effect: You must use VAOs, even to render a simple triangle. Legacy features (like client-side vertex arrays) are not allowed.

Fix: Always generate and bind a VAO before setting up VBOs or rendering.

Not Binding VAO When Setting Vertex Attributes
Problem: glVertexAttribPointer and glEnableVertexAttribArray affect the currently bound VAO.

Effect: If no VAO is bound, attributes silently don’t work.

Fix: Make sure a VAO is bound before setting up attribute pointers.

VAO/VBO Setup Order
Problem: Some developers bind a VAO, then configure the VBO after unbinding the VAO.

Effect: Attributes aren’t stored in the VAO, leading to broken rendering.

Fix: Bind both the VAO and the VBO before calling attribute setup functions.

VAO Being Unbound or Deleted Prematurely
Problem: Deleting or unbinding VAOs at the wrong time can break rendering.

Fix: Keep VAOs bound and alive through configuration and rendering stages.

Apple’s OpenGL Driver Quirks
Problem: Apple’s OpenGL drivers are outdated and buggy.

Effect: Some valid VAO/VBO code may behave incorrectly or fail silently.

Fix: Use glGetError frequently. Consider using helper libraries like GLFW and GLEW.

VAO Not Used in Draw Call
Problem: The VAO must be bound at the time of issuing a draw call.

Fix: Make sure the correct VAO is bound just before glDrawArrays or glDrawElements.

OpenGL Version Limitations on macOS
Maximum versions:

OpenGL 4.1 on supported discrete GPUs
OpenGL 3.2 Core Profile is the baseline
Implication: Features like glVertexAttribFormat (OpenGL 4.3+) are unavailable.

Best Practice Example (macOS-Safe)

Generate and bind a VAO, then bind a VBO and set up vertex attributes while both are bound. Keep the VAO bound when drawing. This avoids silent failures and ensures compatibility with macOS’s core profile restrictions.

If you're debugging VAO issues, compare your setup against known-good examples (such as from learnopengl.com). If you're starting a new project on macOS, consider using Metal or Vulkan instead—OpenGL is deprecated and no longer updated.
