# Selection Subsystem Requirements
*Created: June 18, 2025*

## Overview
The Selection subsystem manages voxel selection and multi-selection operations, providing the foundation for group operations.

## Requirements from Main Requirements Document

### Selection Management
- Support for single and multi-voxel selection
- Selection persistence across operations
- Visual feedback for selected voxels
- Integration with group system for group creation

### State Persistence
- **REQ-8.1.7**: Format shall store vertex selection state

## Implementation Notes
- SelectionManager coordinates selection operations
- SelectionSet manages collections of selected voxels
- BoxSelector, SphereSelector, FloodFillSelector for different selection methods
- SelectionRenderer provides visual feedback for selections
- SelectionTypes defines selection data structures
- Support for selection validation and bounds checking
- Integration with undo/redo system for reversible selections
- Performance optimization for large selections
- Selection serialization for project files
