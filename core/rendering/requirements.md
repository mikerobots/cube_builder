## Overview
The Rendering subsystem provides OpenGL abstraction, shader management, and core rendering pipeline for voxels, grid, and visual effects.

## Requirements from Main Requirements Document

### Grid Rendering
- **REQ-1.1.1**: The ground plane shall display a grid with 32cm x 32cm squares
- **REQ-1.1.2**: The grid shall be positioned at Y=0 (ground level)
- **REQ-1.1.3**: Grid lines shall use RGB(180, 180, 180) at 35% opacity
- **REQ-1.1.4**: Major grid lines every 160cm shall use RGB(200, 200, 200) and be thicker
- **REQ-1.1.5**: The grid origin (0,0,0) shall be at the center of the workspace
- **REQ-1.2.3**: The grid shall extend to cover the entire workspace area

### Shader Support and Visual Effects
- **REQ-4.1.1**: All placement previews shall use green outline rendering
- **REQ-4.2.1**: Face highlighting shall use yellow color (as per DESIGN.md)
- **REQ-2.3.2**: Face highlighting shall clearly indicate which face is selected

### Coordinate System and Transforms
- **REQ-1.1.5**: The grid origin (0,0,0) shall be at the center of the workspace
- **REQ-2.1.3**: Voxels shall always be axis-aligned (no rotation)

### Performance Optimization
- **REQ-6.1.1**: Grid rendering shall maintain 60 FPS minimum (90+ FPS for VR)
- **REQ-6.1.2**: Preview updates shall complete within 16ms
- **REQ-4.1.3**: Preview updates shall be smooth and responsive (< 16ms)
- **REQ-6.2.1**: System shall handle 10,000+ voxels without degradation
- **REQ-6.2.2**: Grid size shall scale with workspace (up to 8m x 8m)
- **REQ-6.3.3**: Rendering buffers shall not exceed 512MB

### Platform Requirements
- **REQ-7.1.1**: System shall support cross-platform desktop compatibility
- **REQ-7.1.2**: System shall support Meta Quest 3 VR platform
- **REQ-7.1.3**: System shall use OpenGL 3.3+ core profile minimum

### Testing Requirements
- **REQ-11.2.1**: System shall provide visual validation via screenshot analysis

### Rendering Pipeline
- **REQ-2.2.3**: The preview shall update in real-time as the mouse moves
- **REQ-4.2.3**: Highlighting shall be visible from all camera angles

## Implementation Notes
- OpenGLRenderer provides low-level OpenGL abstraction
- ShaderManager handles shader compilation and management
- RenderEngine coordinates the rendering pipeline
- RenderState manages OpenGL state efficiently
- GroundPlaneGrid handles grid mesh generation and rendering
- Supports multiple render modes (solid, wireframe, combined)
- Optimized for real-time performance with large scenes
- Cross-platform OpenGL compatibility (3.3+ core profile)
- Frame timing and performance profiling hooks
