## Known Issues 🐛

### Critical Architecture Issues
1. **ShaderManagerSafe Hack**: Duplicate ShaderManager implementation exists specifically for tests
   - Indicates thread safety issues with singleton Logger
   - Tests crash when using regular ShaderManager
   - Located in: ShaderManagerSafe.h/cpp

2. **Missing FrameBuffer Implementation**: 
   - Declared in RenderEngine.h but commented out
   - Required for proper render targets
   - Lines 78, 152-153 in RenderEngine.h

3. **Incomplete GPU Profiling**:
   - GPU timing queries not implemented (OpenGLRenderer.cpp:1176-1186)
   - No performance profiling as designed

### TODO Comments in Code
1. **OpenGLRenderer.cpp**:
   - Line 1176: GPU timing not implemented
   - Debug output code commented out (lines 894, 912-914, 1149)

2. **RenderEngine.cpp**:
   - Line 981: Debug info rendering not implemented
   - Line 1006: Normal visualization not implemented
   - Line 1012: Bounding box visualization not implemented
   - Line 1020: Voxel rendering placeholder

3. **ShaderManager.cpp**:
   - Line 75: Shader hot-reloading not implemented (despite TODO.md claiming it's done)

### Magic Numbers and Constants
1. **GroundPlaneGrid.cpp**:
   - Line 81: `smoothFactor = 10.0f` - hardcoded
   - Line 137: `glLineWidth(1.0f)` - hardcoded
   - Lines 195, 205: `i % 5` - major line interval hardcoded
   - Line 323: `1.2` - major line visibility multiplier

2. **GroundPlaneGrid.h**:
   - Lines 143-149: Color values hardcoded (180.0f/255.0f, 200.0f/255.0f)
   - Line 152: `ProximityRadius = 2.0f` - hardcoded

### Platform-Specific Code Issues
- MacOSGLLoader mixed into core rendering instead of platform abstraction layer
- Platform detection in core code rather than build system

## Technical Debt
1. **Shader System Issues**:
   - No #include support for shader files
   - ShaderManagerSafe hack for testing indicates design flaw
   - Hot-reloading not actually implemented despite being marked complete
   - Thread safety problems with Logger singleton

2. **Architecture Issues**:
   - Type confusion: Multiple aliases for same concepts (BufferId, VertexBufferId, etc.)
   - Inconsistent use of InvalidId vs 0 for validity checks
   - Platform-specific code (MacOSGLLoader) in core layer
   - Missing FrameBuffer implementation

3. **Resource Management**:
   - Manual cleanup required in some cases
   - ShaderProgram destructor empty with TODO comment
   - Mix of RAII and manual patterns

4. **Performance**:
   - Some redundant state changes could be optimized
   - No GPU profiling implementation
   - Limited instanced rendering support

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Limited graceful degradation for GPU errors
   - Try-catch blocks around logging suggest Logger issues
   - No comprehensive error recovery strategy

## Performance Metrics
Current performance with test hardware:
- **Empty scene**: 300+ FPS
- **1,000 voxels**: 120+ FPS
- **10,000 voxels**: 60+ FPS
- **30,000 voxels**: 30+ FPS
- **Frame time**: < 16ms consistently
- **Memory usage**: ~100MB for 10k voxels

## Shader Architecture
### Built-in Shaders
1. **basic**: Simple colored rendering
2. **enhanced**: Normal-based shading with edge detection
3. **flat**: Flat shaded voxels
4. **ground_plane**: Grid rendering with transparency

### Shader Features
- OpenGL 3.3 and 4.1 compatibility
- Automatic version detection
- Hot-reload in debug mode
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Type-safe uniform system

## Dependencies on Other Subsystems
- **Camera**: View and projection matrices
