# Groups Subsystem Requirements
*Created: June 18, 2025*

## Overview
The Groups subsystem handles voxel grouping, operations, and metadata management for organizing and manipulating collections of voxels.

## Requirements from Main Requirements Document

### Group Operations
- Create groups from selected voxels
- Group operations: move, hide/show, lock, copy/duplicate
- Group hierarchy support (nested groups)
- Visual group indicators (color coding, outlines)
- Group management (list, rename, delete)

### Group Metadata
- Group metadata storage in file format
- Group persistence across save/load operations
- Group naming and organization

### Memory Management
- **REQ-6.3.2**: Voxel data storage shall not exceed 2GB

### State Persistence
- **REQ-8.1.8**: Format shall store group definitions and metadata
- **REQ-8.1.9**: Format shall store group visibility states

### Command Line Interface
- **REQ-9.2.5**: CLI shall support group commands (group create/hide/show/list)

## Implementation Notes
- GroupManager coordinates all group operations
- VoxelGroup represents individual groups with metadata
- GroupHierarchy manages nested group structures
- GroupOperations handles move, copy, rotate, scale operations
- GroupTypes defines group data structures and events
- Integration with selection system for group creation
- Integration with visual feedback for group visualization
- Integration with undo/redo for reversible group operations
- Performance optimization for large groups
- Thread-safe group operations
