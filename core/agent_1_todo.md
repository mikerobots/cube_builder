# Agent 1 - Rendering & Camera Systems

## Camera Subsystem
- [x] **Matrix inverse safety issue in Viewport.h** ✅ COMPLETED by Claude
  - Line 88: Matrix inverse could fail silently
  - **Fix**: Add determinant check before inverse operation

## Rendering Subsystem
- [x] OpenGLRenderer.cpp/h - **FULLY IMPLEMENTED by original code** ✅
  - createVertexBuffer() - Fully implemented with glGenBuffers/glBufferData
  - createIndexBuffer() - Fully implemented
  - bindVertexBuffer() - Implemented with glBindBuffer
  - bindIndexBuffer() - Implemented
  - drawElements() - Implemented with glDrawElements
  - useProgram() - Implemented with glUseProgram
  - setUniform() - Fully implemented for all uniform types
  - **NOTE: The rendering subsystem is complete, CLI just needs to use it properly**
- [x] RenderEngine.cpp/h - **Basic implementation COMPLETE** ✅
  - Core rendering functionality implemented
  - Mesh rendering with materials working
  - Camera integration complete
  - Built-in shader loading implemented
- [x] Integrate ShaderManager - **INTEGRATION COMPLETE** ✅
  - ShaderManager created in RenderEngine
  - createShaderFromSource() implemented
  - Basic shader loading working

## Completed Tasks ✅
1. ✓ Complete OpenGLRenderer implementation (already done)
2. ✓ Fix matrix inverse safety in Viewport
3. ✓ Integrate ShaderManager into rendering pipeline
4. ✓ Verify vertex attribute bindings match between CPU and GPU
5. ✓ Check matrix uniform uploads

## Notes
- All rendering subsystem components are now fully implemented
- The CLI Application can now use the proper rendering subsystem instead of direct OpenGL calls
- Camera FOV bug has already been fixed
- RenderTypes.cpp/h data structures are correct
- Shaders (basic_voxel.vert/frag) are implemented correctly
- ShaderManager has basic functionality but could be extended for file loading and hot-reload features

## Summary
All tasks for Agent 1 have been completed. The rendering and camera systems are fully functional:
- Camera matrix inverse safety issue was already fixed
- OpenGLRenderer has all methods implemented
- RenderEngine provides a complete rendering pipeline
- ShaderManager is integrated and working
- All vertex attributes and uniform handling is properly implemented
