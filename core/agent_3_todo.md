# Agent 3 - Visual Feedback & UI Rendering

## Visual Feedback Subsystem
- [x] FeedbackTypes.h/cpp - Issues to fix:
  - Transform::toMatrix() has TODO - needs Matrix4f transformation implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] HighlightRenderer.h/cpp - Major TODOs:
  - GPU resource management (createBoxMesh, createFaceMesh, shader creation) ✅ COMPLETED
  - renderInstanced and renderImmediate methods incomplete ✅ COMPLETED
  - renderMultiSelection needs VoxelId iteration implementation (pending VoxelId finalization)
- [x] OutlineRenderer.h/cpp - Major TODOs:
  - GPU buffer creation and management not implemented ✅ COMPLETED
  - findExternalEdges algorithm incomplete ✅ COMPLETED
  - VoxelOutlineGenerator::generateGroupOutline not implemented ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] OverlayRenderer.h/cpp - Major TODOs:
  - Text rendering system not implemented ✅ COMPLETED
  - GPU resource initialization incomplete ✅ COMPLETED
  - worldToScreen camera projection not implemented ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] FeedbackRenderer.h/cpp - Minor TODO:
  - renderCameraInfo needs actual camera data extraction ✅ COMPLETED

## Priority Tasks
1. ✅ COMPLETED - Implement GPU resource management for all renderer classes
2. ✅ COMPLETED - Complete Transform::toMatrix() implementation in FeedbackTypes
3. ✅ COMPLETED - Implement group outline generation algorithm
4. ✅ COMPLETED - Add OpenGL rendering calls
5. ✅ COMPLETED - Implement text rendering system for overlays
6. ✅ COMPLETED - Add camera projection methods for world-to-screen
7. ✅ COMPLETED - Implement GPU resource cleanup in destructors

## Completed Work (by Claude)
- Fixed Transform::toMatrix() with proper quaternion-to-matrix conversion
- Implemented full GPU resource management in HighlightRenderer
- Added createBoxMesh() with complete vertex/index data
- Added createHighlightShader() with vertex and fragment shaders
- Fixed Matrix4f to add data() method for OpenGL compatibility
- Fixed matrix inverse safety in Viewport.h with determinant check
- Made all OpenGL calls macOS-compatible
- Implemented complete OutlineRenderer with:
  - GPU buffer creation and management
  - Shader compilation for line patterns (solid, dashed, dotted, dash-dot)
  - findExternalEdges algorithm for group outlines
  - VoxelOutlineGenerator::generateGroupOutline implementation
  - Full rendering pipeline with batch support
- Implemented complete OverlayRenderer with:
  - Text rendering system with bitmap font texture
  - Line rendering system for debug overlays
  - worldToScreen camera projection
  - Full GPU resource management
  - Text and line batch rendering
- Fixed OverlayRenderer::renderCameraInfo to extract actual camera data

## Positive Notes
- FaceDetector.h/cpp is fully implemented and working
- Excellent test coverage with comprehensive test cases
- Well-structured module with clear separation of concerns
- Good use of design patterns (Factory, Component)
- Proper CMake configuration with platform support

## Dependencies
- Depends on Agent 1's rendering system fixes
- Text rendering may need external library integration
