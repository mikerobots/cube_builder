# Undo/Redo Subsystem - TODO

## Current Status (Updated: June 18, 2025) ✅ COMPLETED
The undo/redo subsystem has been successfully migrated to the new coordinate system and all requirement tests have been implemented:

### ✅ Completed Work
- **Coordinate System Migration**: All undo/redo code updated to use IncrementCoordinates instead of GridCoordinates
- **PlacementCommands.cpp**: Fixed to use CoordinateConverter and proper coordinate types
- **StateSnapshot.cpp**: Updated to use new VoxelPosition.incrementPos instead of gridPos
- **Test Infrastructure**: Removed unsafe reinterpret_cast usage, now uses real VoxelDataManager with proper event handling
- **All Core Components**: HistoryManager, Command Interface, VoxelCommands, SelectionCommands, CompositeCommand, Transaction, PlacementCommands
- **Requirements Test Coverage**: Created comprehensive test_UndoRedo_requirements.cpp with 13 tests covering all requirements
- **Requirement Traceability**: Added REQ comments to all existing test files

### ✅ Working Components
- **HistoryManager**: Core undo/redo operations with history management
- **Command Interface**: Base command pattern implementation  
- **VoxelCommands**: Basic voxel edit and bulk edit commands
- **SelectionCommands**: Selection modification commands
- **CompositeCommand**: Command grouping functionality
- **Transaction**: Command transaction support
- **PlacementCommands**: Voxel placement/removal with validation
- **StateSnapshot**: State capture and restoration for undo/redo

### ✅ All Tests Passing
- **Coordinate Alignment**: Fixed - All tests now use grid-aligned positions
- **Requirements Coverage**: All 13 requirement tests passing
- **Existing Tests**: All 9 existing unit tests passing
- **Total**: 22 tests with 100% pass rate

### ✅ Resolved Issues
1. **Test Infrastructure**: ✅ Fixed - Now uses real VoxelDataManager with event handling instead of unsafe reinterpret_cast
2. **Coordinate System**: ✅ Fixed - All code migrated to IncrementCoordinates
3. **Architecture**: ✅ Acceptable - Current design works well with the event-driven architecture

### Not Implemented ❌
- Camera commands
- Group commands  
- Workspace commands
- Memory optimization/compression
- Incremental snapshots
- Command indexing

## Requirements Validation ✅ COMPLETED
**Total Requirements**: 3 main + additional from other subsystems

## Requirements Validated

### Command Creation ✅
- [x] REQ-2.3.3: Command creation for placements
  - Clicking on a highlighted face shall place the new voxel adjacent to that face
  - Implemented: PlacementCommand for face-based placement
  
- [x] REQ-5.1.1: Command creation for voxel placement
  - Left-click shall place a voxel at the current preview position
  - Implemented: VoxelPlacementCommand via PlacementCommandFactory
  
- [x] REQ-5.1.2: Command creation for voxel removal
  - Right-click on a voxel shall remove that voxel
  - Implemented: VoxelRemovalCommand via PlacementCommandFactory

### Additional Requirements Validated ✅
- [x] History Management with 5-10 operation limit
- [x] Command pattern implementation for reversible operations
- [x] State management for complex operations
- [x] REQ-6.3.4: Application overhead shall not exceed 1GB
- [x] REQ-8.1.6: Format shall store limited undo history (10-20 operations)
- [x] REQ-9.2.6: CLI shall support undo/redo commands
- [x] Transaction support for atomic operations
- [x] Memory-efficient history with limited depth for VR constraints

## API Review Checklist ✅ COMPLETED

### HistoryManager ✅
- [x] executeCommand() accepts placement commands
- [x] undo() properly reverses voxel placement
- [x] redo() properly re-applies voxel placement
- [x] History size limits (5-10 operations as per DESIGN.md)
- [x] Memory management with setMaxMemoryUsage()
- [x] Snapshot intervals for efficient state restoration

### Command Interface ✅
- [x] Base Command interface supports execute/undo
- [x] Command memory usage tracking
- [x] Command naming and type identification

### VoxelCommands ✅
- [x] VoxelPlacementCommand exists and works
- [x] VoxelRemovalCommand exists and works
- [x] Commands store necessary state (position, resolution, etc.)

### PlacementCommands ✅
- [x] PlacementCommandFactory for creating commands
- [x] Validation for placement (ground plane, overlaps)
- [x] Proper state capture for undo
- [x] Support for all voxel resolutions

## Implementation Tasks
1. Review existing VoxelCommands implementation
2. Create/update PlacementCommands if needed:
   - FacePlacementCommand - for placing on voxel faces
   - GridPlacementCommand - for placing on ground grid
3. Ensure commands capture all necessary state:
   - Position (with 1cm precision)
   - Resolution
   - Adjacent face (for face placement)
   - Timestamp
4. Test undo/redo functionality

7. [x] Transaction tests - TestCommand.cpp, test_UndoRedo_requirements.cpp
8. [x] Composite command tests - TestCommand.cpp
9. [x] Memory constraint tests - test_UndoRedo_requirements.cpp
10. [x] Snapshot efficiency tests - test_UndoRedo_requirements.cpp
