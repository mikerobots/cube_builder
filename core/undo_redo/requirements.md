# Undo/Redo Subsystem Requirements
*Created: June 18, 2025*

## Overview
The Undo/Redo subsystem manages operation history and provides reversible commands for all user actions.

## Requirements from Main Requirements Document

### Command Creation for Voxel Operations
- **REQ-5.1.1**: Left-click shall place a voxel at the current preview position
- **REQ-5.1.2**: Right-click on a voxel shall remove that voxel
- **REQ-2.3.3**: Clicking on a highlighted face shall place the new voxel adjacent to that face

### History Management
- Support for undo/redo operations with 5-10 operation limit (as per DESIGN.md)
- Command pattern implementation for reversible operations
- State management for complex operations
- **REQ-6.3.4**: Application overhead shall not exceed 1GB
- **REQ-8.1.6**: Format shall store limited undo history (10-20 operations)

### Command Line Interface
- **REQ-9.2.6**: CLI shall support undo/redo commands

## Implementation Notes
- Command interface for all reversible operations
- HistoryManager maintains command stack with size limits
- PlacementCommands handle voxel placement/removal
- SelectionCommands handle selection operations
- VoxelCommands provide basic voxel manipulation
- CompositeCommand for multi-step operations
- StateSnapshot for efficient state capture
- Transaction support for atomic operations
- Memory-efficient history with limited depth for VR constraints
