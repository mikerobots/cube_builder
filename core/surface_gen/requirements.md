## Implementation Notes

### Core Components
- **SurfaceGenerator**: Coordinates surface generation and smoothing pipeline
- **DualContouring**: Implements base mesh generation algorithm with topology preservation
- **MeshSmoother**: Progressive smoothing system with multiple algorithms
  - Laplacian smoothing (levels 1-3): Basic smoothing that removes blockiness
  - Taubin smoothing (levels 4-7): Feature-preserving smoothing
  - BiLaplacian smoothing (levels 8-10+): Aggressive smoothing for organic shapes
- **TopologyPreserver**: Ensures loops, holes, and complex geometry remain intact
- **MeshValidator**: Validates output for 3D printing (watertight, manifold, minimum features)
- **MeshBuilder**: Constructs final optimized meshes with proper vertex ordering
- **SurfaceTypes**: Defines mesh data structures and smoothing parameters

### Smoothing Pipeline
1. Generate base mesh using Dual Contouring (preserves topology)
2. Apply selected smoothing algorithm based on user level (0-10+)
3. Validate topology preservation after each smoothing iteration
4. Check printability constraints (watertight, manifold, feature size)
5. Optimize final mesh (remove degenerate triangles, merge vertices)

### Performance Considerations
- Real-time preview updates (<100ms) for interactive smoothing
- Progressive smoothing with cancellation support
- Cached smoothing results for common parameter sets
- GPU acceleration for smoothing operations (future)
- Memory-efficient smoothing for large meshes

### Quality Settings
- **Preview Mode**: Fast smoothing approximation for real-time feedback
- **Export Mode**: Full-quality smoothing with all constraints applied
- **LOD Integration**: Different smoothing levels per LOD for performance

### Export Support
- STL export with validated printable meshes
- Smoothing parameters saved in project files
- Export presets for common 3D printing scenarios
