8. **Documentation complete** (API docs, user guide, examples)

## Priority Order

1. **High Priority**: Core smoothing algorithms (Phase 1) ✓
2. **High Priority**: Topology preservation (Phase 2) ✓
3. **High Priority**: Basic mesh validation (Phase 3.1) ✓

6. **Low Priority**: Performance optimization (Phase 7)
7. **Low Priority**: Documentation (Phase 8)

## Notes

- Each phase should be completed with full unit test coverage before moving to the next
- **IMPORTANT**: Unit tests must be compiled, run, and pass successfully before marking any section as complete
- All test assertions must validate expected behavior, not just compile
- Invalid tests that assume only sharp edge preservation should be removed or updated
- Performance targets: <100ms for preview, <5s for high-quality export
- Memory constraints: Stay within 4GB limit for Meta Quest 3
- All smoothing must preserve the original voxel topology (loops, holes, etc.)

## Test Validation Requirements

Before marking any section as complete:
1. Write comprehensive unit tests covering all functionality
2. Add tests to CMakeLists.txt
3. Build the tests successfully
4. Run the tests and ensure they pass
5. Verify test coverage includes edge cases and error conditions
