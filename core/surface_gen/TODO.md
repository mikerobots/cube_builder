## Implementation Gaps and Issues

### Potential Requirements (Inferred)
Since this subsystem isn't explicitly covered in requirements.md, potential requirements include:

1. **Mesh Generation**: Generate triangle meshes from voxel data
2. **Multi-Resolution**: Support different voxel resolutions in mesh
3. **Quality Control**: Support different quality/performance trade-offs
4. **Export Support**: Generate meshes suitable for STL/OBJ export
5. **Performance**: Handle large voxel datasets efficiently
6. **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage for mesh data

### Code Quality Issues Found

#### MeshBuilder.cpp - Missing Implementations (14 TODOs)
1. **Optimization Features**:
   - `optimizeVertexCache()` - Stub only, needed for GPU cache optimization
   - `generateFlatNormals()` - Stub only, needed for flat shading

2. **UV Mapping Features**:
   - `generateSphericalUVs()` - Incomplete implementation
   - `generateCylindricalUVs()` - Stub only

3. **Mesh Operations**:
   - `transformMesh()` - Stub only, needed for mesh transformations
   - `calculateMeshStatistics()` - Stub only, needed for analysis
   - `repairMesh()` - Stub only, needed for fixing mesh issues

4. **Advanced Mesh Validation**:
   - `isManifold()` - TODO: Implement full manifold check
   - `fillHoles()` - Stub only, needed for watertight meshes
   - `makeWatertight()` - Stub only, critical for 3D printing

5. **Mesh Conversion**:
   - `trianglesToQuads()` - Stub only
   - `subdivide()` - Stub only (e.g., Loop subdivision)
   - `remesh()` - Stub only, needed for mesh quality

#### Test Coverage Issues
- `TestMeshBuilder.cpp` has TODOs for:
  - `MeshUtils::calculateVolume` - Not implemented
  - `MeshUtils::calculateSurfaceArea` - Not implemented

## Test Coverage Needed
1. Basic mesh generation from simple voxel patterns
2. Multi-resolution voxel mesh generation
3. Dual contouring algorithm correctness
4. Mesh optimization and validation
5. Performance tests with large datasets
6. Memory usage tests
7. LOD generation tests
8. Caching functionality tests

## Integration Points
- **VoxelData**: Source of voxel information for mesh generation
- **File I/O**: Potential export destination for generated meshes
- **Rendering**: Meshes may be used for visualization
- **Memory**: Shared memory management for large meshes

## Notes
- This subsystem appears to be complete but not directly used in current requirements
- May be intended for future STL/OBJ export functionality
- Well-structured with proper separation of concerns
- Includes advanced features like LOD, caching, and async generation
- Should verify integration points with VoxelData subsystem
