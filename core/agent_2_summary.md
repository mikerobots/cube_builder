# Agent 2 Task Summary - Voxel Data & Storage Systems

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed VoxelTypes.h
- Removed unnecessary includes: typeindex, queue, mutex, stack, memory, typeinfo, unordered_map
- Kept only essential includes: cstdint, cmath, algorithm, Vector3f.h, Vector3i.h

### 2. Fixed VoxelGrid.h
- Removed all debug output (cout statements)
- Removed iostream include

### 3. Fixed SparseOctree.h/cpp
- Removed all debug output (5 locations)
- Added deallocateSubtree() method to prevent stack overflow during recursive deletion
- Fixed node count tracking in removeVoxelRecursive
- Removed unused variable

### 4. Fixed VoxelDataManager.h
- Removed unnecessary includes: unordered_map, typeindex, queue, algorithm, stack, memory/MemoryTracker.h
- Kept thread-safe operations with mutex

### 5. Fixed WorkspaceManager.h
- Simplified verbose namespace qualifications (replaced ::VoxelEditor::VoxelData:: with local names)
- Removed unnecessary includes: vector, memory, unordered_map, typeindex, queue, mutex

### 6. Updated Tests to Match API Changes
- Fixed test method names: isPositionInBounds → isPositionValid
- Fixed test method names: getMaxGridDimensions → getGridDimensions
- Fixed test method names: worldToGridPos → worldToGrid
- Fixed test method names: gridToWorldPos → gridToWorld
- Fixed test method names: hasVoxel → getVoxel
- Fixed test method names: hasVoxelAtWorldPos → getVoxelAtWorldPos

## Build Status
- The code compiles successfully with Ninja
- Test suite builds successfully

## Test Results
- 76 tests total
- 57 tests passing
- 19 tests failing

## Remaining Issues (Test Failures)
The failing tests indicate several architectural mismatches between test expectations and implementation:

1. **Coordinate System Mismatch**: Tests expect centered workspace coordinates (-size/2 to +size/2) while implementation uses (0 to size)
2. **Event System**: Events are not being dispatched properly
3. **Position Validation**: Negative coordinates are rejected by SparseOctree but tests expect them to work
4. **Memory Tracking**: Memory usage calculations return 0

## Recommendations for Future Work
1. Decide on consistent coordinate system (0-based vs centered)
2. Fix event dispatching in VoxelDataManager
3. Update test expectations to match implementation behavior
4. Implement proper memory tracking in SparseOctree
