# File I/O Subsystem Requirements
*Created: June 18, 2025*

## Overview
The File I/O subsystem handles project save/load operations and export functionality for sharing and 3D printing.

## Requirements from Main Requirements Document

### Binary Format Specification
- **REQ-8.1.1**: Custom binary format shall include file header with version and metadata
- **REQ-8.1.2**: Format shall store workspace dimensions and settings
- **REQ-8.1.3**: Format shall store multi-resolution voxel data for all 10 levels
- **REQ-8.1.4**: Format shall store current active resolution level
- **REQ-8.1.5**: Format shall store camera position and view settings
- **REQ-8.1.6**: Format shall store limited undo history (10-20 operations)
- **REQ-8.1.7**: Format shall store vertex selection state
- **REQ-8.1.8**: Format shall store group definitions and metadata
- **REQ-8.1.9**: Format shall store group visibility states
- **REQ-8.1.10**: Format shall include creation and modification timestamps

### Export and Compression
- **REQ-8.2.1**: System shall export STL files for 3D printing and sharing
- **REQ-8.2.2**: System shall support format versioning for backward compatibility
- **REQ-8.2.3**: System shall use LZ4 compression for efficient storage

### Memory Management
- **REQ-6.3.4**: Application overhead shall not exceed 1GB

### Dependencies
- **REQ-7.3.4**: System shall use LZ4 compression for file storage

### Command Line Interface
- **REQ-9.2.4**: CLI shall support file commands (save, load, export)

## Implementation Notes
- FileManager coordinates all file operations
- BinaryFormat handles custom binary format specification
- Project represents complete project state
- STLExporter handles mesh export to STL format
- Compression provides LZ4 compression wrapper
- FileVersioning manages format version compatibility
- BinaryIO provides low-level binary read/write operations
- FileTypes defines file format constants and structures
- Integration with all core subsystems for complete state capture
- Error handling and validation for file operations
- Cross-platform file compatibility
