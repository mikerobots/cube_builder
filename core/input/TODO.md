# Input Subsystem - TODO

## 🚨 CRITICAL: COORDINATE SYSTEM MIGRATION REQUIRED

**IMPORTANT**: The foundation coordinate system has been simplified, but this subsystem still uses the old GridCoordinates system and needs immediate updating.

### 📖 REQUIRED READING
**BEFORE STARTING**: Read `/coordinate.md` in the root directory to understand the new simplified coordinate system.

### 🎯 Migration Overview
Update the Input subsystem from the old GridCoordinates system to the new simplified coordinate system:
- **OLD**: GridCoordinates with complex grid-to-world conversions
- **NEW**: IncrementCoordinates (1cm granularity) for all voxel operations, centered at origin (0,0,0)

### 📋 Migration Tasks (HIGH PRIORITY)

- [x] **Update PlacementValidation.h** - Replace GridCoordinates with IncrementCoordinates
- [x] **Update PlaneDetector.h** - Use IncrementCoordinates for plane detection  
- [x] **Update InputTypes.h** - Replace GridCoordinates in input event structures
- [x] **Update mouse/touch handlers** - Use IncrementCoordinates for position tracking

#### Phase 2: Update Implementation Files ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] **Update PlacementValidation.cpp** - Use IncrementCoordinates for voxel placement validation

- [x] **Fix Issues** - Address any failing tests or compilation errors (NO ISSUES FOUND)

### 🔧 Key Code Changes Required

```cpp
// OLD - Remove all instances of:
GridCoordinates gridPos;
convertWorldToGrid();
convertGridToWorld();
#include "GridCoordinates.h"

## Known Issues 🐛
- None currently - all tests passing!

## Technical Debt
1. **VRComfortSettings Structure**: Referenced but needs full implementation
2. **Input Metrics**: No built-in performance counters for latency tracking
3. **Platform Integration Classes**: Integrated into InputManager rather than separate (by design)
4. **Gesture Recognizer**: Embedded in handlers rather than separate component (by design)

## Dependencies on Other Subsystems
- **Visual Feedback**: For cursor highlighting and preview rendering
- **Camera**: For ray casting transformations
- **VoxelData**: For placement validation and overlap checks
- **CLI**: For command processing integration

## Recent Improvements (January 2025)

### Code Quality Fixes
1. **Fixed Frame Rate Assumption**: `updatePlanePersistence()` now takes deltaTime parameter instead of hardcoded 60 FPS
2. **Fixed Direct Plane Assignment**: Now uses `clearCurrentPlane()` method instead of direct member manipulation
3. **Optimized Resolution Detection**: Created `VoxelInfo` structure to avoid O(n) resolution checks
4. **Removed Inefficient Methods**: Eliminated O(n³) `getVoxelCount()` method
5. **Fixed Overlap Detection**: Simplified to use VoxelDataManager's efficient `wouldOverlap()` method
6. **Added Named Constants**: Replaced magic numbers with `MAX_VOXEL_SEARCH_HEIGHT` and `DEFAULT_SEARCH_RADIUS`
7. **Proper Validation**: `isValidIncrementPosition()` now actually validates Y >= 0
8. **Fixed Test Issues**: 
   - Fixed PlaneDetector tests using incorrect grid coordinates (was using cm values instead of grid units)
   - Changed float comparisons from EXPECT_FLOAT_EQ to EXPECT_NEAR with appropriate tolerance

### Original Implementation
- PlacementValidation component for voxel placement validation and snapping
- PlaneDetector for intelligent multi-level voxel placement
- Comprehensive test coverage for all input scenarios
