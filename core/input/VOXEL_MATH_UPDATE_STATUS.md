# Input Subsystem - Voxel Math Update Status

## Work Completed by Zara

### 1. Review and Documentation
- Created VOXEL_MATH_CHANGES.md documenting what needs to be changed
- Identified opportunities to use voxel_math library functions

### 2. Code Updates
- Added VoxelEditor_VoxelMath dependency to CMakeLists.txt
- Updated PlacementValidation.cpp to use:
  - `WorkspaceValidation::isAboveGroundPlane()` for ground plane checks
  - `WorkspaceValidation::createBounds()` and `voxelFitsInBounds()` for bounds validation
  - `VoxelCollision::getVoxelsInRegion()` for nearby voxel detection
- Moved voxel_math includes to implementation file to avoid circular dependencies

### 3. Current Status
- PlacementValidation.cpp compiles successfully with voxel_math integration
- Input library itself builds without errors
- Other modules have compilation errors preventing full system build and testing

### 4. Benefits Achieved
- Replaced manual validation logic with optimized voxel_math functions
- Reduced code duplication
- Improved maintainability

### 5. Remaining Work
- Full system needs to be fixed to run unit tests
- Verify that all tests pass once build issues are resolved
- Consider additional opportunities to use voxel_math in other input files

## Notes
The voxel_math integration is complete from the input subsystem perspective. The compilation errors are in other modules (rendering, file_io, groups) that need to be updated for recent API changes.
