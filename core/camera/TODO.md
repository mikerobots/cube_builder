# Camera Subsystem - Requirements Validation

## Overview
This subsystem manages 3D camera movement, view presets, and ray generation for input.
**Total Requirements**: 3

## Requirements to Validate

### View Matrices
- [ ] REQ-1.1.2: View matrices for grid at Y=0
  - The grid shall be positioned at Y=0 (ground level)
  - Camera view matrices must properly transform grid at Y=0

### View Independence
- [ ] REQ-4.2.3: View independence for highlighting
  - Highlighting shall be visible from all camera angles
  - Camera transforms must preserve highlight visibility

### Ray Transformation
- [ ] REQ-5.1.4: Ray transformation for mouse
  - Ray-casting shall determine face/position under cursor
  - Camera must provide screen-to-world ray transformation

## API Review Checklist

### Camera
- [ ] Check getViewMatrix() properly positions Y=0 grid
- [ ] Check getProjectionMatrix() maintains proper perspective
- [ ] Check screenToWorldRay() generates accurate rays

### OrbitCamera
- [ ] Check orbit controls maintain Y=0 as ground
- [ ] Check zoom functionality preserves ray accuracy
- [ ] Check rotation doesn't affect highlight visibility

### CameraController
- [ ] Check view presets properly show Y=0 grid
- [ ] Check smooth transitions maintain ray accuracy
- [ ] Check reset functionality returns to valid state

### Viewport
- [ ] Check viewport transforms for ray generation
- [ ] Check aspect ratio handling
- [ ] Check screen coordinate to NDC conversion

## Implementation Tasks
1. Verify ray generation accuracy:
   - Screen coordinates → NDC → World ray
   - Must work at all zoom levels
   - Must work with all view presets
2. Test Y=0 grid visibility:
   - Grid must be visible in all standard views
   - Grid must be at correct position
3. Ensure highlight visibility:
   - Depth testing configuration
   - No view angle should hide active highlights

## Test Coverage Needed
1. Ray generation accuracy tests
2. View matrix tests (Y=0 positioning)
3. Screen-to-world coordinate tests
4. Zoom level ray accuracy tests
5. View preset tests
6. Highlight visibility from multiple angles

## Issues Found During Review

### Code Quality Issues
1. **Viewport Ray Generation**: The `screenToWorldRay` method has a potential issue with perspective divide - it's creating rays without proper perspective divide for the clip space points.
2. **Hard-coded Values**: Several magic numbers like drag threshold (3.0f), smoothing reference FPS (60.0f), and zoom normalization (800.0f).
3. **Missing Error Handling**: No validation of matrix inversions beyond determinant check.
4. **Inconsistent Coordinate Systems**: Comments mention screen space as top-left origin, but NDC conversion assumes bottom-left.

### Design Issues
1. **Limited View Presets**: Only 7 hardcoded presets, no way to add custom presets as originally designed.
2. **No Animation System**: The original design called for a dedicated CameraAnimator, but only basic smoothing is implemented.
3. **Missing Features**: No keyboard shortcuts implementation, no touch/VR support.
4. **Event System**: Only basic event dispatch, no event data beyond change type.

### Performance Concerns
1. **Matrix Recalculation**: While caching is implemented, the dirty flag system could lead to redundant updates when multiple properties change.
2. **Smoothing System**: Uses deltaTime * 60 which assumes 60 FPS baseline - may behave differently at other framerates.

### Testing Gaps
1. No integration tests with rendering system
2. No performance benchmarks
3. No multi-threaded access testing
4. No error recovery tests
