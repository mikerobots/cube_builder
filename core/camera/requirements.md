# Camera Subsystem Requirements
*Created: June 18, 2025*
*Updated: December 18, 2024*

## Overview
The Camera subsystem manages 3D camera movement, view presets, and coordinate transformations for ray-casting and rendering. It provides the foundation for 3D visualization and interaction in the voxel editor.

## Requirements from Main Requirements Document

### View Matrices and Coordinate Support
- **REQ-1.1.2**: The grid shall be positioned at Y=0 (ground level)
  - Camera view matrices must properly transform and display the ground plane grid at Y=0
  - The camera system must maintain proper coordinate transformations with the centered coordinate system
  
- **REQ-5.1.4**: Ray-casting shall determine face/position under cursor
  - Camera must provide accurate screen-to-world ray transformation for mouse input
  - Ray generation must work correctly across all zoom levels and view angles
  - Ray transformation must integrate with the input system for precise voxel selection

### View Independence
- **REQ-4.2.3**: Highlighting shall be visible from all camera angles
  - Camera transforms must preserve highlight visibility regardless of view angle
  - Depth testing configuration must ensure highlights are never occluded by the view angle
  - Camera system must support view-independent rendering for visual feedback

### State Persistence
- **REQ-8.1.5**: Format shall store camera position and view settings
  - Camera state (position, rotation, zoom) must be serializable
  - Camera settings must be restored accurately when loading project files
  - State persistence must include active view preset if applicable

### Command Line Interface
- **REQ-9.2.2**: CLI shall support camera commands (zoom, view, rotate, reset)
  - Camera system must expose controls for:
    - Zoom in/out operations
    - View preset selection (front, back, top, bottom, left, right, isometric)
    - Rotation controls (orbit around target)
    - Reset to default view
  - Commands must provide smooth transitions between states

## Implementation Requirements

### Core Camera Functionality
- **REQ-CAM-1**: Camera system shall provide orbit-style controls
  - Orbit around a target point (default: workspace center at 0,0,0)
  - Support for both mouse and programmatic control
  - Smooth interpolation for camera movements

- **REQ-CAM-2**: Camera shall support multiple view projections
  - Perspective projection for 3D visualization
  - Orthographic projection support (future requirement)
  - Proper aspect ratio handling for viewport changes

- **REQ-CAM-3**: Camera shall maintain consistent coordinate system
  - Work with centered coordinate system (origin at 0,0,0)
  - Y-up orientation
  - Proper handling of negative coordinates

### View Presets
- **REQ-CAM-4**: Camera shall provide standard view presets
  - Front view: Looking along -Z axis
  - Back view: Looking along +Z axis
  - Top view: Looking down along -Y axis
  - Bottom view: Looking up along +Y axis
  - Left view: Looking along +X axis
  - Right view: Looking along -X axis
  - Isometric view: Standard 3D perspective

- **REQ-CAM-5**: View transitions shall be smooth
  - Animated transitions between view presets
  - Configurable transition duration
  - No jarring movements or orientation flips

### Ray Generation
- **REQ-CAM-6**: Camera shall provide accurate ray generation
  - Convert screen coordinates to world-space rays
  - Account for viewport dimensions and aspect ratio
  - Proper perspective or orthographic ray calculation
  - Support for different screen coordinate conventions

### Performance Requirements
- **REQ-CAM-7**: Camera operations shall be performant
  - Matrix calculations cached when possible
  - View/projection matrix updates < 1ms
  - Ray generation < 0.1ms per ray
  - Smooth movement at 60+ FPS

### Integration Requirements
- **REQ-CAM-8**: Camera shall integrate with other subsystems
  - Provide view/projection matrices to rendering system
  - Generate rays for input system
  - Dispatch events for camera changes
  - Support state serialization for file I/O

## Implementation Notes
- OrbitCamera class provides primary implementation
- CameraController manages view presets and transitions
- Viewport class handles screen-to-world transformations
- Event system notifies other subsystems of camera changes
- Matrix caching optimizes repeated calculations
- Smooth transitions use time-based interpolation
- Camera bounds prevent invalid positions
- Default view positioned to show entire workspace
