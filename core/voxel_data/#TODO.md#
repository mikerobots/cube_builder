# VoxelData Subsystem - Requirements Validation

## Overview
This subsystem manages multi-resolution voxel storage and workspace coordination.
**Total Requirements**: 21

## Requirements to Validate

### Workspace and Coordinate System
- [ ] REQ-1.1.5: Grid origin at workspace center (WorkspaceManager)
  - The origin (0,0,0) shall be at the center of the workspace
  - 5m³ default workspace has coordinates from -2.5m to +2.5m on each axis
  
- [ ] REQ-1.2.3: Grid extends to cover entire workspace (workspace bounds)
  - The grid shall extend to cover the entire workspace area

### Position Validation and Constraints
- [ ] REQ-2.1.1: Voxels placeable only at 1cm increments (position validation)
  - Voxels shall be placeable only at 1cm increment positions
  
- [ ] REQ-2.1.2: 32 valid positions per axis in 32cm cell (coordinate system)
  - Within each 32cm grid cell, there shall be exactly 32 valid positions per axis
  
- [ ] REQ-2.1.3: Voxels always axis-aligned (voxel representation)
  - Voxels shall always be axis-aligned (no rotation)
  
- [ ] REQ-2.1.4: No voxels below Y=0 (bounds validation)
  - No voxels shall be placed below Y=0

### Adjacent Position Calculations
- [ ] REQ-2.3.3: Adjacent position calculation for face placement
  - Clicking on a highlighted face shall place the new voxel adjacent to that face

### Voxel Alignment and Relationships
- [ ] REQ-3.1.1: Same-size voxel alignment calculation
  - Same-size voxels shall auto-snap to perfect alignment by default
  
- [ ] REQ-3.1.3: Edge matching for aligned placement
  - Aligned placement means edges match perfectly with the target face
  
- [ ] REQ-3.2.2: Sub-grid positioning on faces
  - Placement shall respect 1cm increment positions on the target face

### Collision Detection
- [ ] REQ-3.3.2: Collision detection for placement
  - Placement plane shall maintain height while preview overlaps any voxel at current height
  
- [ ] REQ-3.3.3: Spatial queries for height sorting
  - When multiple voxels at different heights are under cursor, highest takes precedence

### Placement Validation
- [ ] REQ-4.1.2: Validation for invalid placements
  - Invalid placements shall show red outline preview
  
- [ ] REQ-4.3.1: Collision detection for overlaps
  - System shall prevent overlapping voxel placements
  
- [ ] REQ-4.3.2: Validation results for invalid placements
  - Invalid placement attempts shall show red preview
  
- [ ] REQ-4.3.3: Validation results for valid placements
  - Valid placements shall show green preview

### Voxel Operations
- [ ] REQ-5.1.1: Voxel creation
  - Left-click shall place a voxel at the current preview position
  
- [ ] REQ-5.1.2: Voxel removal
  - Right-click on a voxel shall remove that voxel
  
- [ ] REQ-5.2.1: Overlap detection
  - Voxels shall not overlap with existing voxels
  
- [ ] REQ-5.2.2: Pre-placement validation
  - System shall validate placement before allowing it
  
- [ ] REQ-5.2.3: Y≥0 bounds checking
  - Only positions with Y ≥ 0 shall be valid

### Resolution Management
- [ ] REQ-5.3.1: Active resolution state
  - Current voxel size controlled by active resolution setting
  
- [ ] REQ-5.3.2: Resolution switching
  - Resolution changed via `resolution <size>` command
  
- [ ] REQ-5.3.3: Resolution definitions (1cm to 512cm)
  - Available resolutions: 1cm, 2cm, 4cm, 8cm, 16cm, 32cm, 64cm, 128cm, 256cm, 512cm

### Performance and Scalability
- [ ] REQ-6.2.2: Workspace bounds up to 8m x 8m
  - Grid size shall scale with workspace (up to 8m x 8m)

## API Review Checklist

- [ ] Check sparse storage implementation
- [ ] Check memory efficiency for large datasets

### WorkspaceManager
- [ ] Check workspace center is at origin (0,0,0)
- [ ] Check workspace bounds calculation

2. Bounds checking tests (Y≥0)
3. Overlap detection tests
4. Resolution switching tests
5. Workspace coordinate tests
6. Performance tests with 10,000+ voxels
7. Adjacent position calculation tests
8. Alignment calculation tests
