# Voxel Data Subsystem Requirements
*Created: June 18, 2025*

## Overview
The Voxel Data subsystem manages multi-resolution voxel storage, workspace bounds, position validation, and collision detection.

## Requirements from Main Requirements Document

### Coordinate System and Workspace
- **REQ-1.1.5**: The grid origin (0,0,0) shall be at the center of the workspace
- **REQ-1.2.3**: The grid shall extend to cover the entire workspace area
- **REQ-6.2.2**: Grid size shall scale with workspace (up to 8m x 8m)

### Position Validation and Bounds
- **REQ-2.1.1**: Voxels shall be placeable only at 1cm increment positions
- **REQ-2.1.2**: Within each 32cm grid cell, there shall be exactly 32 valid positions per axis
- **REQ-2.1.3**: Voxels shall always be axis-aligned (no rotation)
- **REQ-2.1.4**: No voxels shall be placed below Y=0
- **REQ-5.2.3**: Only positions with Y ≥ 0 shall be valid

### Multi-Resolution Support
- **REQ-2.2.4**: All voxel sizes (1cm to 512cm) shall be placeable at any valid 1cm increment position on the ground plane
- **REQ-5.3.1**: Current voxel size controlled by active resolution setting
- **REQ-5.3.3**: Available resolutions: 1cm, 2cm, 4cm, 8cm, 16cm, 32cm, 64cm, 128cm, 256cm, 512cm

### Voxel Placement and Management
- **REQ-3.1.1**: Same-size voxels shall auto-snap to perfect alignment by default
- **REQ-3.1.3**: Aligned placement means edges match perfectly with the target face
- **REQ-3.2.2**: Placement shall respect 1cm increment positions on the target face
- **REQ-2.3.3**: Clicking on a highlighted face shall place the new voxel adjacent to that face
- **REQ-5.1.1**: Left-click shall place a voxel at the current preview position
- **REQ-5.1.2**: Right-click on a voxel shall remove that voxel

### Collision Detection and Spatial Queries
- **REQ-3.3.2**: Placement plane shall maintain height while preview overlaps any voxel at current height
- **REQ-3.3.3**: When multiple voxels at different heights are under cursor, highest takes precedence
- **REQ-4.3.1**: System shall prevent overlapping voxel placements
- **REQ-5.2.1**: Voxels shall not overlap with existing voxels
- **REQ-5.2.2**: System shall validate placement before allowing it

### Validation and Error Handling
- **REQ-4.1.2**: Invalid placements shall show red outline preview
- **REQ-4.3.2**: Invalid placement attempts shall show red preview
- **REQ-4.3.3**: Valid placements shall show green preview

### Performance and Scalability
- **REQ-6.1.4**: Resolution switching shall complete within 100ms
- **REQ-6.2.1**: System shall handle 10,000+ voxels without degradation
- **REQ-6.3.1**: Total application memory shall not exceed 4GB (Meta Quest 3 constraint)
- **REQ-6.3.2**: Voxel data storage shall not exceed 2GB
- **REQ-6.3.5**: System shall detect and respond to memory pressure

### File Format Storage
- **REQ-8.1.2**: Format shall store workspace dimensions and settings
- **REQ-8.1.3**: Format shall store multi-resolution voxel data for all 10 levels
- **REQ-8.1.4**: Format shall store current active resolution level

### Command Line Interface
- **REQ-9.2.3**: CLI shall support voxel commands (resolution, workspace, render)

## Implementation Notes
- Uses centered coordinate system with origin at workspace center
- Supports sparse storage for memory efficiency (sparse octree data structure)
- Provides collision detection for all resolution combinations
- Manages workspace bounds dynamically (2m³ min, 8m³ max, 5m³ default)
- Validates positions at 1cm increment precision
- Memory pooling and object reuse for performance
- Automatic memory pressure detection and cleanup
- Real-time editing across all 10 resolution levels
