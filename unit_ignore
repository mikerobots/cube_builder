# Unit Test Exclusion List
# Add directory paths (one per line) to exclude their unit tests from running
# Lines starting with '#' are comments
# Paths should be relative to the project root

# Example:
# ./foundation/math
# ./core/camera

# Completed subsystems:
# ./foundation/math  # Uncomment when math tests are stable
./foundation
./core/voxel_data
