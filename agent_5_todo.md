# Agent 5 Subsystem Review - TODO

## Summary
This document summarizes the review of four core subsystems: Groups, File I/O, Input, and Undo/Redo.

## Critical Blocking Issues

### 1. File I/O Subsystem - CRITICAL
The File I/O subsystem has the most significant blocking issues:

**BinaryFormat.cpp** - Multiple unimplemented methods:
- Line 320-355: Eight methods marked with `// TODO: Implement`
- Missing implementations for critical read/write operations
- This blocks saving/loading functionality entirely

**Compression.cpp** - Incomplete compression support:
- Line 108-137: Voxel-specific compression not implemented
- LZ4 compression integration missing
- Checksum calculation not implemented (line 26)

**FileVersioning.cpp** - Version migration system incomplete:
- Line 17-85: Core version detection, upgrade, and migration functions not implemented
- This blocks file format evolution and backwards compatibility

**STLExporter.cpp** - Import functionality missing:
- Line 446-504: STL import (both binary and ASCII) not implemented
- Only export functionality is complete

### 2. Undo/Redo Subsystem - CRITICAL
Major functionality gaps in state management:

**StateSnapshot.cpp** - Core snapshot functionality missing:
- Line 27-161: Voxel data, camera state, and render settings capture/restore not implemented
- Line 266-297: Compression and serialization not implemented
- This blocks the entire undo/redo system from functioning

**HistoryManager.cpp** - Snapshot operations incomplete:
- Line 438-443: Snapshot creation and restoration not implemented

### 3. Groups Subsystem - MINOR
Mostly complete with minor gaps:

**GroupOperations.cpp**:
- Line 396: Sophisticated scaling with resampling marked as TODO
- Line 693: Rotation and scale application marked as TODO
- These are enhancement TODOs, not blocking issues

### 4. Input Subsystem - MINOR
Very minimal issues:

**InputMapping.cpp**:
- Line 391: JSON parsing marked as TODO (but basic implementation exists)

**VRInputHandler.cpp**:
- Line 565: Comment about gesture recognition implementation (appears to be implemented)

## Recommendations for Other Agents

1. **File I/O Agent**: Must complete BinaryFormat.cpp methods before any save/load functionality can work
2. **Undo/Redo Agent**: Must implement StateSnapshot capture/restore before undo/redo can function
3. **Compression Agent**: Should implement voxel-specific compression in Compression.cpp
4. **Version Migration Agent**: Must implement FileVersioning.cpp for future-proofing

## Integration Dependencies

1. **Groups → VoxelDataManager**: Dependency exists and appears properly integrated
2. **File I/O → All subsystems**: Needs access to serialize/deserialize all data types
3. **Undo/Redo → StateSnapshot**: Critical dependency on unimplemented StateSnapshot
4. **Input → EventDispatcher**: Properly integrated

## Quality Assessment

| Subsystem | Completeness | Blocking Issues | Quality |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|---------|
| Groups | 95% | None | Good |
| File I/O | 60% | Critical | Poor |
| Input | 98% | None | Excellent |
| Undo/Redo | 70% | Critical | Poor |

## Next Steps

1. Prioritize implementing BinaryFormat.cpp methods
2. Implement StateSnapshot capture/restore functionality
3. Complete FileVersioning system for migration support
4. Add compression implementation
5. Implement STL import functionality

The File I/O and Undo/Redo subsystems have critical blocking issues that prevent core functionality from working. These should be addressed before attempting integration work.
